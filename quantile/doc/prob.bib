	an extension of the uniform law for bridges obtained by Knight.},

	the $\alpha$-quantile of $X$ up to time $t$, i.e., the smallest value
	$x$ for which the time spent by $X$ below $x$ before $t$ exceeds
	$\alpha t$. The main result of the paper is that $M(\alpha, t)$ has
	the same distribution as the sum of the maximum of $X$ up to time
	$\alpha t$ and the minimum of an independent copy of $X$ up to time
	$(1- \alpha) t$. This is proved analytically by computing the Laplace
	transform of $M(\alpha, t)$ with the help of the Feynman-Kac formula.

  number = {3},
  abstract = {{Let $X$ be a real-valued Brownian motion with drift. Define for $0
	\leq \alpha \leq 1$ $$M(\alpha, t) = \inf \Biggl\{ x : \int^1_0 1_{\{X_s
	\leq x\}} ds &gt; \alpha t \Biggr\},$$ the $\alpha$-quantile of the
	occupation measure of $X$ on the time interval $[0,t]$. Motivated
	by questions in mathematical finance on the pricing of options, {\it
	A. Dassios} [ibid. 5, No. 2, 389-398 (1995; Zbl 0837.60076)] observed
	the following striking identity in law: $$M(\alpha, t) \overset (d)
	\to = \sup_{0 \leq s \leq \alpha t} X_s + \inf_{0 \leq s \leq (1
	- \alpha)t} X_s', \tag *$$ where $X'$ is an independent copy of $X$.
	As a matter of fact, a discrete time version of this identity has
	been previously proven by {\it J. G. Wendel} [Ann. Math. Stat. 31,
	1034-1044 (1960; Zbl 0118.33701)] and {\it S. C. Port} [J. Math.
	Anal. Appl. 6, 109-151 (1963; Zbl 0114.34101)] in their study of
	ordered statistics of partial sums. The paper under review contains
	two proofs of the identity (*). The first relies on the celebrated
	identity of Sparre-Andersen, and the second on a path decomposition
	of Brownian motion with drift which extends an earlier result of
	the reviewer [in: S\'eminaire de probabilit\'es XXV, Lect. Notes
	Math. 1485, 330-344 (1991; Zbl 0741.60077)]. More recently, the latter
	approach has been extended by {\it Chaumont, M. Yor} and the reviewer
	[``Two chain-transformations and their applications to quantiles''
	(to appear in J. Appl. Probab.)] to explain a more general version
	of (*).}},
