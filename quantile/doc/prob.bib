	Abstract = {We develop lower and upper bounds on the prices of American call and put options written on a dividend-paying asset. We provide two option price approximations, one based on the lower bound (termed LBA) and one based on both bounds (termed LUBA). The LUBA approximation has an average accuracy comparable to a 1,000-step binomial tree with a computation speed comparable to a 50-step binomial tree. We introduce a modification of the binomial method (termed BBSR) that is very simple to implement and performs remarkably well. We also conduct a careful large-scale evaluation of many recent methods for computing American option prices.},

@article{EmRoge1995,
	Abstract = {{Let $X$ be a real-valued Brownian motion with drift. Define for $0
	\leq \alpha \leq 1$ $$M(\alpha, t) = \inf \Biggl\{ x : \int^1_0 1_{\{X_s
	\leq x\}} ds &gt; \alpha t \Biggr\},$$ the $\alpha$-quantile of the
	occupation measure of $X$ on the time interval $[0,t]$. Motivated
	by questions in mathematical finance on the pricing of options, {\it
	A. Dassios} [ibid. 5, No. 2, 389-398 (1995; Zbl 0837.60076)] observed
	the following striking identity in law: $$M(\alpha, t) \overset (d)
	\to = \sup_{0 \leq s \leq \alpha t} X_s + \inf_{0 \leq s \leq (1
	- \alpha)t} X_s', \tag *$$ where $X'$ is an independent copy of $X$.
	As a matter of fact, a discrete time version of this identity has
	been previously proven by {\it J. G. Wendel} [Ann. Math. Stat. 31,
	1034-1044 (1960; Zbl 0118.33701)] and {\it S. C. Port} [J. Math.
	Anal. Appl. 6, 109-151 (1963; Zbl 0114.34101)] in their study of
	ordered statistics of partial sums. The paper under review contains
	two proofs of the identity (*). The first relies on the celebrated
	identity of Sparre-Andersen, and the second on a path decomposition
	of Brownian motion with drift which extends an earlier result of
	the reviewer [in: S\'eminaire de probabilit\'es XXV, Lect. Notes
	Math. 1485, 330-344 (1991; Zbl 0741.60077)]. More recently, the latter
	approach has been extended by {\it Chaumont, M. Yor} and the reviewer
	[``Two chain-transformations and their applications to quantiles''
	(to appear in J. Appl. Probab.)] to explain a more general version
	of (*).}},

	Abstract = {This article values option contracts based on the average price realized
	over a finite time horizon. Such contracts are of importance to traders
	who periodically transact in spot markets and who require protection
	from adverse moves in their total accrued costs realized over their
	trading horizons. Explicit valuation models for pricing a variety
	of path dependent contracts based on geometric and arithmetic averages
	are developed. The early exercise features of American contracts
	are investigated, and it is shown that this feature has significant
	value.},
