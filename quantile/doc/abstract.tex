\chapter{Abstract}
Option is the one popular derivative traded in market. 
%So evaluate the value of options is
%a very important question in finicial industry.
%However the return of options can only be determined when it is exercised.
%So option pricing became a very difficult problem.
In the most important model, Black-Scholes model, for option pricing, 
the price of underling asset is assumed to 
satisfy the geometric Brownian motion, 
which is a very interesting object itself. 
We will have a quick review about the theory of option pricing
in the fist part of this thesis.
%So option priceing is a  very interesting and important problem
%both in practical and theratical. 
It is well known that Black-Scholes formula solves pricing problem 
for European option.
However, for other types of options, usually there is no such nice formula. 
Numerical methods are developed to solve these problems. 
In this thesis, we consider the $\alpha$-quantile options. 
Partially because the $\alpha$-quantiles of Brownian motion 
are highly path-dependent, many fundamental problems are still open.
One problem is the discretization error between the $\alpha$-quantile 
of Brownian motion and that of Gaussian random walk. 
This is the first step to find the order of approximation for numerical 
methods based on Gaussian random walk.
We have found a big difference between the
convergence patterns of the discrete error for genuine $\alpha$-quantiles $(0< \alpha < 1)$
and the maximum ($\alpha=1$) by simulation. 
Moreover we show these differences theoretically.
Another problem is using tree methods to price 
$\alpha$-quantile options. A forward shooting method for European-style $\alpha$-quantile option originally proposed by \cite{Kwok2001} are studied. We propose a tree method which can price both European and American-style of $\alpha$-quantile options. Richardson extrapolation is applied to accelerate the convergence speed of our lattice method.
