  title = {L-functoriality for dual pairs.},
  year = {1989},
  abstract = {{[For the entire collection see Zbl 0694.00012.] \par This paper considers
	the notion of functoriality for the correspondence given by the oscillator
	representation for a dual reductive pair $(G,G')$ in Sp(2n,${\bbfR})$,
	assuming the oscillator representation factors to $G\times G'.$ \par
	There are counterexamples to the obvious conjecture in terms of L-
	packets, so the author proposes using the larger packets called Arthur-
	packets. These packets are parametrized by admissible maps $\Psi$
	: $W\sb R\times SL(2,{\bbfC})\to\sp LG$. The conjecture is that given
	$G,G'$, there is (after possibly exchanging $G,G')$ a map $\gamma$
	: ${}\sp LG\to\sp LG'$ and a fixed homomorphism T: SL(2,${\bbfC})\to\sp
	LG'$, which describe the correspondence. \par The conjecture states
	that if a representation $\pi$ occurring in the correspondence is
	in the Arthur-packet determined by $\Psi$, then its image $\pi '$
	is in the Arthur-packet determined by $\Psi '(w,g)=\gamma \circ \Psi
	(w,g)T(g)$. The author proves this conjecture in many cases, showing
	it to be consistent with all known examples. There is also a conjecture
	concerning the correspondence not just between G and $G'$ but between
	all their inner forms.}},

	center and let GK denote the centralizer of a maximal compact subgroup
	K of G inG, the universal enveloping algebra over C of the Lie algebra
	of G. In [4] Lepowsky defines an injective anti-homo morphism P:GK?KM?A,
	where M is the centralizer in K of a Cartan subalgebraa of the symmetric
	pair (G,K),K andA are the universal enveloping algebras over C corresponding
	to K anda, respectively, andKM is the centralizer of M inK. The subalgebra
	P(GK) ofKM?A has considerable significance in the infinite dimensional
	representation theory of G. In this paper we explicitly compute P(GK)
	when G=S0o(4,1), and show how this result leads to the determination
	of all irreducible representations of G and its universal covering
	group Spin(4,1).},

	introduced by Li in Invent. Math. 27 (1989) 237-255. Let (G1,G2)
	be a type I dual pair with G1 the smaller group. Let [pi] be an irreducible
	unitary representation in the semistable range of [theta](MG1,MG2)
	(see Communications in Contemporary Mathematics, Vol. 2, 2000, pp.
	255-283). We prove that the invariant Hermitian form (,)[pi] is positive
	semidefinite under certain restrictions on the size of G2 and a mild
	growth condition on the matrix coefficients of [pi]. Therefore, if
	(,)[pi] does not vanish, [theta](MG1,MG2)([pi]) is unitary. Theta
	correspondence over was established by Howe in (J. Amer. Math. Soc.
	2 (1989) 535-552). Li showed that theta correspondence preserves
	unitarity for dual pairs in stable range. Our results generalize
	the results of Li for type I classical groups (Invent. Math. 27 (1989)
	237). The main result in this paper can be used to construct irreducible
	unitary representations of classical groups of type I.},

	roots are compact. Let be the parabolic subalgebra of for which em-em+1
	contributes to and the other simple roots contribute to , let L be

	Let be the unique irreducible quotient of . The representations under

	For s>2l-2, it is known that [pi]s=[pi]s' and that [pi]s' is in the
	discrete series. Enright, Parthsarathy, Wallach, and Wolf showed
	for m[less-than-or-equals, slant]s[less-than-or-equals, slant]2l-2
	that [pi]s=[pi]s' and that [pi]s' is still unitary. The present paper

	slant]m-1 even though [pi]s[not equal to][pi]s', and it relates the
	K spectrum of the representations [pi]s' to the representation of
	on a suitable R(Y) with Y depending on s. Use of a branching formula
	of D. E. Littlewood allows one to obtain an explicit multiplicity
	formula for each K type in [pi]s'; the variety Y is indispensable
	in the proof. The chief tools involved are an idea of B. Gross and
	Wallach, a geometric interpretation of Littlewood's theorem, and
	some estimates of norms. It is shown further that the natural invariant
	Hermitian form on [pi]s' does not make [pi]s' unitary for s<0 and
	that the K spectrum of [pi]s' in these cases is not related in the
	above way to the representation of on any R(Y). A final section of
	the paper treats in similar fashion the simply connected Lie group
	with Lie algebra , 2[less-than-or-equals, slant]m[less-than-or-equals,

	A finite multiplicity theorem is established for discretely decomposable

	denote the respective complexified Lie algebras. Then every irreducible
	representation π of g which is semisimple under f and whose irreducible
	f components integrate to finite-dimensional irreducible representations
	of K is shown to be equivalent to a subquotient of a representation
	of g belonging to the infinitesimal nonunitary principal series.
	It follows that π integrates to a continuous irreducible Hilbert
	space representation of G, and the best possible estimate for the
	multiplicity of any finite-dimensional irreducible representation
	of f in π is determined. These results generalize similar results
	of Harish-Chandra, R. Godement and J. Dixmier. The representations
	of g in the infinitesimal nonunitary principal series, as well as
	certain more general representations of g on which the center of
	the universal enveloping algebra of g acts as scalars, are shown
	to have (finite) composition series. A general module-theoretic result
	is used to prove that the distribution character of an admissible
	Hilbert space representation of G determines the existence and equivalence
	class of an infinitesimal composition series for the representation,
	generalizing a theorem of N. Wallach. The composition series of Weyl-group-related
	members of the infinitesimal nonunitary principal series are shown
	to be equivalent. An expression is given for the infinitesimal spherical
	functions associated with the nonunitary principal series. In several

	simplifications as well as generalizations of certain results of

	This paper analyses this local theta lifting between discrete series
	representations of $\tilde G'$ and unitary representations of $\tilde

	in the case of irreducible type I reductive dual pairs that if the

  abstract = {{Consider reductive dual pairs of the form $(G,G')=(O(p,q),Sp(2n,\Bbb
	R)),(U(p,q),U(m,n))$ and $(Sp(p,q),O^*(2n))$ in the stable range,
	with $G'$ the smaller member. In this paper, the authors study the
	theta lifts of unitary lowest weight modules of $G'$, in particular
	the geometry of their associated varieties. Since by {\it J.-S. Li}
	[Invent. Math. 97, No.2, 237-255 (1989; Zbl 0694.22011)], unitarity
	is preserved by the Howe correspondence in the stable range, these
	are (very singular) unitary representations of $G$. \par Let $\germ
	g=\germ k \oplus \germ s$ and $\germ g'=\germ k' \oplus \germ s'$
	be the Cartan decompositions of the complexified Lie algebras of
	$G$ and $G'$, respectively. For any nilpotent $K'_{\Bbb C}$-orbit
	$\Cal O'$ in $\germ s'$, {\it K. Nishiyama, H. Ochiai} and {\it C.-B.
	Zhu} [Theta lifting of nilpotent orbits for symmetric pairs, Trans.
	Am. Math. Soc., to appear] have defined in a natural way the theta
	lift $\theta(\Cal O')$, a nilpotent $K_{\Bbb C}$-orbit in $\germ
	s$. If $\pi'$ is a unitary lowest weight module of $G'$ then its
	associated variety $\Cal {AV}(\pi')$ consists of the closure of a
	single such orbit, and its associated cycle $\Cal {AC}(\pi')$ must
	be an integral multiple thereof. The main result is that the associated
	variety of the theta lift of $\pi'$ is the theta lift of the associated
	variety of $\pi'$, and the multiplicity in the associated cycles
	is preserved under the lifting. Moreover, a formula for this multiplicity
	is given. If (as is almost always the case) $\pi'$ occurs in the
	correspondence for a dual pair $(G(k),G')$ with $G(k)$ compact as
	the theta lift of a representation $\sigma$ of $G(k)$, then this
	is a simple formula in terms of the dimension of $\sigma$. Generalizing
	the first part of the theorem, the authors show that if $\rho'$ is
	any irreducible admissible (not necessarily unitary) representation
	of $G'$ whose associated variety is irreducible (hence the closure
	of a single nilpotent orbit $\Cal O'$), then the associated variety
	of the theta lift of $\rho'$ is contained in the closure of $\theta(\Cal
	O')$. \par In addition, back in the setting of $\pi'$ a unitary lowest
	weight module with theta lift $\pi$, the authors obtain a formula
	for the $K$-structure of $\pi$ in terms of the $K'$-structure of
	$\pi'$.}},

	admissible representations of some two-fold covers of G and G'. We
	determine this correspondence explicitly for dual pairs of the form
	(U(p,q),U(r,s)) withr+s=p+q, and describe it in terms of Langlands
	parameters. In this case, the correspondence may be understood in
	a natural way as a correspondence of representations of the linear
	groups, rather than the appropriate covers. We show that every irreducible
	admissible representation ofU(p,q) occurs in the correspondence with
	precisely one unitary group of equal rank. This result verifies a
	conjecture of Harris, Kudla, and Sweet, who investigated the correspondence
	for unitary groups of equal size overp-adic fields. The correspondence
	of discrete series representations was determined by J.-S. Li. For
	induced representations, the correspondence is obtained in a natural
	way from the corresponding discrete series on the respective Levi
	factors of the parabolic subgroups ofU(p,q) andU(r,s). Generalizing
	a result of Li, we show that under the correspondence representations
	with nonzero cohomology are matched in an interesting way, with unitarity
	not necessarily preserved. The proof uses the induction principle
	which is due to Kudla, and an argument involvingK-types and the space
	of joint harmonics (Howe).},

	theory of group representations. The above representation, of the
	real special orthogonal group, which arises from the right action
	of this group on the underlying vector space (of the symmetric algebra)
	of matrices, possesses interesting properties when restricted to
	the Stiefel manifold. The latter is defined as the orbit (under the
	action of the real special orthogonal group) of the n by k matrix
	formed by the first n row vectors of the canonical basis of the k-dimensional
	real Euclidean space. Thus the last part of this paper is involved
	with questions in harmonic analysis on this Stiefel manifold. In
	particular, an interesting orthogonal decomposition of the complex
	Hilbert space consisting of all square-integrable functions on the
	Stiefel manifold is also obtained.},

  title = {Associated varieties and unipotent representations.},
  year = {1991},
  abstract = {{Let $G_0$ be a connected real semisimple Lie group with finite center
	and Lie algebra ${\germ g}_0$. Let $K_0$ and ${\germ k}_0$ be a maximal
	compact subgroup of $G_0$ and its Lie algebra, respectively. To any
	admissible representation $\pi$ of $G_0$ one attaches its Harish-Chandra
	module $X$ of $K_0$-finite vectors, which carries an algebraic action
	of the complexification $K$ of $K_0$ and a (compatible) Lie algebra
	representation of the complexification $\germ g$ of ${\germ g}_0$.
	If $\pi$ is of finite length, then $X$ is finitely generated over
	the enveloping algebra $U$ of $\germ g$. In this case, given any
	good filtration of the $U$-module $X$ by $K$-invariant subspaces,
	the associated graded module $\text {gr }X$ is finitely generated
	over $\text{gr } U = S({\germ g})$. Since the ideal generated by
	$\germ k$ in $S({\germ g})$ annihilates $\text {gr }X$, we can view
	the latter as a finitely generated $S({\germ g}/{\germ k})$-module.
	The zero set of its annihilator is called the associated variety
	$\cal V$ of $X$; it is a $K$-stable subvariety of $({\germ g}/{\germ
	k})^*$. Using the Killing form and a complexified Cartan decomposition
	${\germ g} = {\germ k} + {\germ p}$ of ${\germ g}_0$, we may identify
	$\cal V$ with a $K$-stable subvariety of the cone ${\cal N}$ of nilpotent
	elements in $\germ p$. By results of {\it B. Kostant} and {\it S.
	Rallis} [Am. J. Math. 93, 753-809 (1971; Zbl 0224.22013)], $\cal
	N$ has only finitely many $K$-orbits, whence so too does $\cal V$.
	By results of {\it J. Sekiguchi} [J. Math. Soc. Japan 39, 127-138
	(1987; Zbl 0627.22008)], the orbits of $K$ in $\germ p$ stand in
	1-1 correspondence with nilpotent $G_0$ orbits in ${\germ g}_0$.
	Thus one may pass from representations of $G_0$ to nilpotent orbits.
	The method of coadjoint orbits attempts to proceed in the opposite
	direction, from nilpotent orbits to representations. The (as yet
	undefined) representations so obtained are called unipotent. -- The
	author discusses a number of partial results and tantalizing conjectures
	relating irreducible Harish- Chandra modules to their associated
	varieties. The results and conjectures are motivated and inspired
	by the orbit method mentioned above.}},

	see p. 223] relates this problem to computations of cohomology of
	infinite-dimensional representations of the corresponding semisimple
	group. More precisely, the problem is the following: Suppose G is
	a reductive Lie group with Lie algebra ${\frak g}$ and maximal compact
	subgroup K. Find all unitary irreducible representations $\pi$ such
	that (*) $H\sp*({\frak g},K,\pi)\ne 0$ or more generally $H\sp*({\frak

  abstract = {{Let $G$ be a classical group over $\bbfR$ (orthogonal, unitary etc.)
	and $V$ the space of its standard representation. The $G$-invariant
	tempered distributions on $V\sp k$ are studied by the following method.
	One defines an appropriate symplectic form on $W=V\sp{2k}$ such that
	$G$ is part of a dual pair $(G,G')$ in $Sp(W)$. We then have the
	oscillator representation of the 2-fold cover $\widetilde Sp(W)$
	of $Sp(W)$ and $\widetilde G'$ acts on the space $S$ of $G$-invariant
	tempered distributions on $V\sp k$. Now the irreducible representations
	of a maximal compact subgroup of $\widetilde G'$ which occur in $S$
	are determined, and their multiplicity is proved to be one. Also,
	an embedding of $S$ into the space of generalized functions on a
	representation space of $\widetilde G'$ (induced from a character
	of a parabolic subgroup) is constructed.}},
