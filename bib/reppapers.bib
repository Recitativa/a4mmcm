	Annote = {In this paper we give a complete description of the points of reducibility, components and composition series of the degenerate principal series representations of the group Sp(n, F), F a non-archimedean local field, which are induced from a character of a maximal parabolic subgroup P = MN with Levi subgroup M ≊GL(n, F) . We show that all of the reducibility is accounted for by submodules coming from the Weil representation associated to quadratic forms over F . The local results of this paper play an essential role in our extension of the Siegel-Weil formula relating theta integrals and special values of Eisenstein series.},

	Abstract = {{[For the entire collection see Zbl 0694.00012.] \par This paper considers
	the notion of functoriality for the correspondence given by the oscillator
	representation for a dual reductive pair $(G,G')$ in Sp(2n,${\bbfR})$,
	assuming the oscillator representation factors to $G\times G'.$ \par
	There are counterexamples to the obvious conjecture in terms of L-
	packets, so the author proposes using the larger packets called Arthur-
	packets. These packets are parametrized by admissible maps $\Psi$
	: $W\sb R\times SL(2,{\bbfC})\to\sp LG$. The conjecture is that given
	$G,G'$, there is (after possibly exchanging $G,G')$ a map $\gamma$
	: ${}\sp LG\to\sp LG'$ and a fixed homomorphism T: SL(2,${\bbfC})\to\sp
	LG'$, which describe the correspondence. \par The conjecture states
	that if a representation $\pi$ occurring in the correspondence is
	in the Arthur-packet determined by $\Psi$, then its image $\pi '$
	is in the Arthur-packet determined by $\Psi '(w,g)=\gamma \circ \Psi
	(w,g)T(g)$. The author proves this conjecture in many cases, showing
	it to be consistent with all known examples. There is also a conjecture
	concerning the correspondence not just between G and $G'$ but between
	all their inner forms.}},

	this, several results concerning the spherical Fourier transform
	on the real group are reduced to the corresponding results for the

	c-function nor the series expansion for the spherical function are
	used. For the proof of the main result some analysis of independent
	interest on pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces is developed. Such

	of the modules we consider is such that their derived functors are
	nontrivial in more than one degree; at the extreme degrees where
	the cohomology is nonvanishing, it is possible to determine the K-spectrum

	Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the positivity of the Hermitian form (,)[pi]
	introduced by Li in Invent. Math. 27 (1989) 237-255. Let (G1,G2)
	be a type I dual pair with G1 the smaller group. Let [pi] be an irreducible
	unitary representation in the semistable range of [theta](MG1,MG2)
	(see Communications in Contemporary Mathematics, Vol. 2, 2000, pp.
	255-283). We prove that the invariant Hermitian form (,)[pi] is positive
	semidefinite under certain restrictions on the size of G2 and a mild
	growth condition on the matrix coefficients of [pi]. Therefore, if
	(,)[pi] does not vanish, [theta](MG1,MG2)([pi]) is unitary. Theta
	correspondence over was established by Howe in (J. Amer. Math. Soc.
	2 (1989) 535-552). Li showed that theta correspondence preserves
	unitarity for dual pairs in stable range. Our results generalize
	the results of Li for type I classical groups (Invent. Math. 27 (1989)
	237). The main result in this paper can be used to construct irreducible
	unitary representations of classical groups of type I.},

	part of the harmonic analysis on the Heisenberg group, the group-theoretic
	embodiment of Heisenberg's Canonical Commutation Relations. The symbol
	mapping is given a group-theoretic interpretation consistent with
	the Kirillov method of orbits. By comparing different well-known
	realizations of the unique irreducible representation of the Heisenberg
	group, the Toeplitz operators on the complex n-ball are shown essentially
	to be pseudo-differential operators. The proof of the Calder-Vaillancourt
	estimate is almost purely group-theoretic. Criteria for positivity,

	let G be a simply connected Lie group with as Lie algebra, let be
	the complexification of the usual Cartan decomposition, let K be
	the analytic subgroup with Lie algebra , and let be the universal
	enveloping algebra of . This work examines the unitarity and K spectrum
	of representations in the #analytic##continuation# of discrete series
	of G, relating these properties to orbits in the nilpotent radical
	of a certain parabolic subalgebra of . The roots with respect to
	the usual compact Cartan subalgebra are all 眅i眅j with 1[less-than-or-equals,
	slant]i<j[less-than-or-equals, slant]l. In the usual positive system
	of roots, the simple root em-em+1 is noncompact and the other simple
	roots are compact. Let be the parabolic subalgebra of for which em-em+1
	contributes to and the other simple roots contribute to , let L be
	the analytic subgroup of G with Lie algebra , let , let be the sum
	of the roots contributing to , and let be the parabolic subalgebra
	opposite to . The members of are nilpotent members of . The group
	acts on with finitely many orbits, and the topological closure of
	each orbit is an irreducible algebraic variety. If Y is one of these
	varieties, let R(Y) be the dual coordinate ring of Y; this is a quotient
	of the algebra of symmetric tensors on that carries a fully reducible
	representation of . For , let . Then [lambda]s defines a one-dimensional
	module . Extend this to a module by having act by 0, and define .
	Let be the unique irreducible quotient of . The representations under
	study are and , where and [Pi]S is the Sth derived Bernstein functor.
	For s>2l-2, it is known that [pi]s=[pi]s' and that [pi]s' is in the
	discrete series. Enright, Parthsarathy, Wallach, and Wolf showed
	for m[less-than-or-equals, slant]s[less-than-or-equals, slant]2l-2
	that [pi]s=[pi]s' and that [pi]s' is still unitary. The present paper
	shows that [pi]s' is unitary for 0[less-than-or-equals, slant]s[less-than-or-equals,
	slant]m-1 even though [pi]s[not equal to][pi]s', and it relates the
	K spectrum of the representations [pi]s' to the representation of
	on a suitable R(Y) with Y depending on s. Use of a branching formula
	of D. E. Littlewood allows one to obtain an explicit multiplicity
	formula for each K type in [pi]s'; the variety Y is indispensable
	in the proof. The chief tools involved are an idea of B. Gross and
	Wallach, a geometric interpretation of Littlewood's theorem, and
	some estimates of norms. It is shown further that the natural invariant
	Hermitian form on [pi]s' does not make [pi]s' unitary for s<0 and
	that the K spectrum of [pi]s' in these cases is not related in the
	above way to the representation of on any R(Y). A final section of
	the paper treats in similar fashion the simply connected Lie group
	with Lie algebra , 2[less-than-or-equals, slant]m[less-than-or-equals,

	module Ω p,q(l) which is the Howe quotient corresponding to the determinant
	character $\det ^{l}$ of U(p,q). We first give a description of the
	tempered distributions on Mp+q,n(C) which transform according to
	the character $\det ^{-l}$ under the linear action of U(p,q). We
	then show that after tensoring with a character, Ω p,q(l) can be
	embedded into one of the degenerate series representations of U(n,n).
	This allows us to determine the module structure of Ω p,q(l). Moreover
	we show that certain irreducible constituents in the degenerate series
	can be identified with some of these representations Ω p,q(l) or
	their irreducible quotients. We also compute the Gelfand-Kirillov
	dimensions of the irreducible constituents of the degenerate series.},

	Abstract = {Let G be a noncompact connected real semisimple Lie group with finite
	center, and let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let g and f
	denote the respective complexified Lie algebras. Then every irreducible
	representation π of g which is semisimple under f and whose irreducible
	f components integrate to finite-dimensional irreducible representations
	of K is shown to be equivalent to a subquotient of a representation
	of g belonging to the infinitesimal nonunitary principal series.
	It follows that π integrates to a continuous irreducible Hilbert
	space representation of G, and the best possible estimate for the
	multiplicity of any finite-dimensional irreducible representation
	of f in π is determined. These results generalize similar results
	of Harish-Chandra, R. Godement and J. Dixmier. The representations
	of g in the infinitesimal nonunitary principal series, as well as
	certain more general representations of g on which the center of
	the universal enveloping algebra of g acts as scalars, are shown
	to have (finite) composition series. A general module-theoretic result
	is used to prove that the distribution character of an admissible
	Hilbert space representation of G determines the existence and equivalence
	class of an infinitesimal composition series for the representation,
	generalizing a theorem of N. Wallach. The composition series of Weyl-group-related
	members of the infinitesimal nonunitary principal series are shown
	to be equivalent. An expression is given for the infinitesimal spherical
	functions associated with the nonunitary principal series. In several
	instances, the proofs of the above results and related results yield
	simplifications as well as generalizations of certain results of
	Harish-Chandra.},

	Abstract = {{Given a dual reductive pair $(G,G')$ inside $Sp=Sp\sb{2n}({\bbfR})$
	in the sense of Howe the Weil representation provides a certain relation
	between the representation theory of $G'$ and the one of G (more
	precisely, between the ones of the inverse images $\tilde G'$ resp.
	$\tilde G$ inside the metaplectic two-fold cover $\tilde Sp$ of $Sp$).
	This paper analyses this local theta lifting between discrete series
	representations of $\tilde G'$ and unitary representations of $\tilde
	G$ with nonvanishing relative Lie algebra cohomology. It is shown
	in the case of irreducible type I reductive dual pairs that if the
	``size'' of $G'$ is not greater than that of G and $\pi'$ is a sufficiently
	regular discrete series representation of $\tilde G'$ then it has
	a nonzero theta lifting to $\tilde G.$ This representation $\theta(\pi')=\pi$
	is a unitary one with nonzero cohomology. Varying $\tilde G'$ one
	obtains a large collection of unitary representations of $\tilde
	G$ with nonzero cohomology and, for $G=SO(n,1)$ or $SU(n,1)$, all
	of them. \par This local result can be used to construct global automorphic
	forms (via global theta lifting) which have cohomological significance,
	i.e. provide nontrivial cohomology classes for certain arithmetic
	cocompact subgroups of $\tilde G.$ This is carried through by the
	author in a yet unpublished paper [Nonvanishing theorems for the

	Abstract = {{Let G be a complex semisimple Lie group and U(${\frak g})$ the universal
	enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra ${\frak g}$. The author studies
	U(${\frak g})$-bimodules A which in addition carry the structure
	(in a compatible way) of a unital associative algebra. He calls such
	an algebra a Dixmier algebra if the kernel of the corresponding natural
	map U(${\frak g})\to A$ is a maximal unipotent ideal [see {\it D.
	Barbasch} and {\it D. A. Vogan}, Ann. Math., II. Ser. 121, 41-110
	(1985; Zbl 0582.22007) Def. 5.23 for a precise definition] and A
	is completely reducible as a bimodule. A is called strongly prime
	if the product of two nonzero U(${\frak g})$-bisubmodules is nonzero
	and completely prime if the product of two nonzero elements is nonzero.
	\par Barbasch and Vogan have shown that one can associate Dixmier
	algebras to nilpotent orbits in ${\frak g}\sp*$ and parametrize them
	by certain groups coming with the orbit. The paper under review deals
	with the question when these Dixmier algebras are strongly prime.
	In the case that the group associated to the orbit is abelian there
	is a complete answer. The author uses his results to disprove a conjecture

	completely prime Dixmier algebras and ramified covers of orbit closures

	Abstract = {{Consider reductive dual pairs of the form $(G,G')=(O(p,q),Sp(2n,\Bbb
	R)),(U(p,q),U(m,n))$ and $(Sp(p,q),O^*(2n))$ in the stable range,
	with $G'$ the smaller member. In this paper, the authors study the
	theta lifts of unitary lowest weight modules of $G'$, in particular
	the geometry of their associated varieties. Since by {\it J.-S. Li}
	[Invent. Math. 97, No.2, 237-255 (1989; Zbl 0694.22011)], unitarity
	is preserved by the Howe correspondence in the stable range, these
	are (very singular) unitary representations of $G$. \par Let $\germ
	g=\germ k \oplus \germ s$ and $\germ g'=\germ k' \oplus \germ s'$
	be the Cartan decompositions of the complexified Lie algebras of
	$G$ and $G'$, respectively. For any nilpotent $K'_{\Bbb C}$-orbit
	$\Cal O'$ in $\germ s'$, {\it K. Nishiyama, H. Ochiai} and {\it C.-B.
	Zhu} [Theta lifting of nilpotent orbits for symmetric pairs, Trans.
	Am. Math. Soc., to appear] have defined in a natural way the theta
	lift $\theta(\Cal O')$, a nilpotent $K_{\Bbb C}$-orbit in $\germ
	s$. If $\pi'$ is a unitary lowest weight module of $G'$ then its
	associated variety $\Cal {AV}(\pi')$ consists of the closure of a
	single such orbit, and its associated cycle $\Cal {AC}(\pi')$ must
	be an integral multiple thereof. The main result is that the associated
	variety of the theta lift of $\pi'$ is the theta lift of the associated
	variety of $\pi'$, and the multiplicity in the associated cycles
	is preserved under the lifting. Moreover, a formula for this multiplicity
	is given. If (as is almost always the case) $\pi'$ occurs in the
	correspondence for a dual pair $(G(k),G')$ with $G(k)$ compact as
	the theta lift of a representation $\sigma$ of $G(k)$, then this
	is a simple formula in terms of the dimension of $\sigma$. Generalizing
	the first part of the theorem, the authors show that if $\rho'$ is
	any irreducible admissible (not necessarily unitary) representation
	of $G'$ whose associated variety is irreducible (hence the closure
	of a single nilpotent orbit $\Cal O'$), then the associated variety
	of the theta lift of $\rho'$ is contained in the closure of $\theta(\Cal
	O')$. \par In addition, back in the setting of $\pi'$ a unitary lowest
	weight module with theta lift $\pi$, the authors obtain a formula
	for the $K$-structure of $\pi$ in terms of the $K'$-structure of
	$\pi'$.}},

	Abstract = {Roger Howe proved that for any reductive dual pair (G,G') in the symplectic
	groupSp(2n,?, there is a one-to-one correspondence of irreducible
	admissible representations of some two-fold covers of G and G'. We
	determine this correspondence explicitly for dual pairs of the form
	(U(p,q),U(r,s)) withr+s=p+q, and describe it in terms of Langlands
	parameters. In this case, the correspondence may be understood in
	a natural way as a correspondence of representations of the linear
	groups, rather than the appropriate covers. We show that every irreducible
	admissible representation ofU(p,q) occurs in the correspondence with
	precisely one unitary group of equal rank. This result verifies a
	conjecture of Harris, Kudla, and Sweet, who investigated the correspondence
	for unitary groups of equal size overp-adic fields. The correspondence
	of discrete series representations was determined by J.-S. Li. For
	induced representations, the correspondence is obtained in a natural
	way from the corresponding discrete series on the respective Levi
	factors of the parabolic subgroups ofU(p,q) andU(r,s). Generalizing
	a result of Li, we show that under the correspondence representations
	with nonzero cohomology are matched in an interesting way, with unitarity
	not necessarily preserved. The proof uses the induction principle
	which is due to Kudla, and an argument involvingK-types and the space
	of joint harmonics (Howe).},

	algebra of complex-valued polynomial functions on the complex vector
	space of n by k matrices. In this context, a generalization of the
	so-called "classical separation of variables theorem" for the symmetric
	algebra is obtained. The second part is devoted to the study of certain
	linear representations, on the above linear space (the symmetric
	algebra) and its subspaces, of the complex general linear group of
	order k and of its subgroups, namely, the unitary group, and the
	real and complex special orthogonal groups. The results of the first
	part lead to generalizations of several well-known theorems in the
	theory of group representations. The above representation, of the
	real special orthogonal group, which arises from the right action
	of this group on the underlying vector space (of the symmetric algebra)
	of matrices, possesses interesting properties when restricted to
	the Stiefel manifold. The latter is defined as the orbit (under the
	action of the real special orthogonal group) of the n by k matrix
	formed by the first n row vectors of the canonical basis of the k-dimensional
	real Euclidean space. Thus the last part of this paper is involved
	with questions in harmonic analysis on this Stiefel manifold. In
	particular, an interesting orthogonal decomposition of the complex
	Hilbert space consisting of all square-integrable functions on the
	Stiefel manifold is also obtained.},

	Abstract = {{Let $G_0$ be a connected real semisimple Lie group with finite center
	and Lie algebra ${\germ g}_0$. Let $K_0$ and ${\germ k}_0$ be a maximal
	compact subgroup of $G_0$ and its Lie algebra, respectively. To any
	admissible representation $\pi$ of $G_0$ one attaches its Harish-Chandra
	module $X$ of $K_0$-finite vectors, which carries an algebraic action
	of the complexification $K$ of $K_0$ and a (compatible) Lie algebra
	representation of the complexification $\germ g$ of ${\germ g}_0$.
	If $\pi$ is of finite length, then $X$ is finitely generated over
	the enveloping algebra $U$ of $\germ g$. In this case, given any
	good filtration of the $U$-module $X$ by $K$-invariant subspaces,
	the associated graded module $\text {gr }X$ is finitely generated
	over $\text{gr } U = S({\germ g})$. Since the ideal generated by
	$\germ k$ in $S({\germ g})$ annihilates $\text {gr }X$, we can view
	the latter as a finitely generated $S({\germ g}/{\germ k})$-module.
	The zero set of its annihilator is called the associated variety
	$\cal V$ of $X$; it is a $K$-stable subvariety of $({\germ g}/{\germ
	k})^*$. Using the Killing form and a complexified Cartan decomposition
	${\germ g} = {\germ k} + {\germ p}$ of ${\germ g}_0$, we may identify
	$\cal V$ with a $K$-stable subvariety of the cone ${\cal N}$ of nilpotent
	elements in $\germ p$. By results of {\it B. Kostant} and {\it S.
	Rallis} [Am. J. Math. 93, 753-809 (1971; Zbl 0224.22013)], $\cal
	N$ has only finitely many $K$-orbits, whence so too does $\cal V$.
	By results of {\it J. Sekiguchi} [J. Math. Soc. Japan 39, 127-138
	(1987; Zbl 0627.22008)], the orbits of $K$ in $\germ p$ stand in
	1-1 correspondence with nilpotent $G_0$ orbits in ${\germ g}_0$.
	Thus one may pass from representations of $G_0$ to nilpotent orbits.
	The method of coadjoint orbits attempts to proceed in the opposite
	direction, from nilpotent orbits to representations. The (as yet
	undefined) representations so obtained are called unipotent. -- The
	author discusses a number of partial results and tantalizing conjectures
	relating irreducible Harish- Chandra modules to their associated
	varieties. The results and conjectures are motivated and inspired
	by the orbit method mentioned above.}},

	Abstract = {{An important problem in the theory of automorphic forms is to compute
	cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. Matsushima's formula [{\it
	A. Borel} and {\it N. R. Wallach}, Continuous cohomology, discrete
	subgroups, and representations of reductive groups (1980; Zbl 0443.22010),
	see p. 223] relates this problem to computations of cohomology of
	infinite-dimensional representations of the corresponding semisimple
	group. More precisely, the problem is the following: Suppose G is
	a reductive Lie group with Lie algebra ${\frak g}$ and maximal compact
	subgroup K. Find all unitary irreducible representations $\pi$ such
	that (*) $H\sp*({\frak g},K,\pi)\ne 0$ or more generally $H\sp*({\frak
	g},K,\pi \otimes F)\ne 0$ where F is finite-dimensional. \par The
	paper under review describes all Harish-Chandra modules satisfying
	(*). The results are sharp in the sense that $\pi$ and $H\sp*({\frak
	g},K,\pi \otimes F)$ are very explicit. The representation $\pi$
	is obtained by what is known as the ``derived functors construction''
	from a 1-dimensional unitary character on a Levi subgroup. Their
	unitarity is only conjectured (established later by {\it D. Vogan}
