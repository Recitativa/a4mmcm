\section{Notation and useful facts}
Let $G$ be a Lie group and $\fgg$ is the Lie algebra of $G$.
\begin{Def}
We say that $\pi:\cE\to M$ is a  $G$-equivariant fiber bundle if $G$ act smoothly on left both on $\cE$ and $M$ such that 
\[
\gamma \circ \pi = \pi \circ \gamma \quad \forall \gamma\in G.
\]
When $\cE$ is a vector bundle, we require in addition that the $G$
action on fiber, $\gamma^\cE:\cE_x \to \cE_{\gamma\cdot x}$,  is linear.

Now $G$ act on the space of sections $\Gamma(M,\cE)$ by 
\[
(\gamma\cdot s)(x) = \gamma^\cE\cdot s(\gamma^{-1}\cdot x) \quad
\forall x\in M, s\in \Gamma(M,\cE). 
\]
For $X \in \fgg$, we denote $\cL^\cE(X)$ the infinitesimal action of
$\Gamma(M,\cE)$, 
\[
\cL^\cE(X) s =\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0} exp(tX)\cdot s,
\]
which is called the Lie derivative.
\end{Def}
For any vector field $X$ on $M$, it defines a famliy of diffeomorphisms $\phi_t$
on $M$ for sufficient small $t$. This diffeomorphism will induce the
Lie derivative on tensor bundles, denote by $\cL(X)$. 

Now consider the bundle of exterior differentials $\bigwedge
T^*M$, denote $\cA(M)=\Gamma(M,\bigwedge T^*M)$  the space of
differential forms, which is a graded algebra by nature grading
inherited from $\bigwedge T^*M$.
Denote $\cA(M,\cE)=\Gamma(M,\bigwedge T^*M\otimes \cE)$  the space
of $\cE$ valued differential forms. We can take $\cE$ be the trivial
line bundle on $M$, then $\cA(M) \cong \cA(M,\cE)$ as $\cA(M)$ module.  

For any differential form $\alpha$, denote the
left exterior multiplication  by $\alpha$ operator on $\cA(M, \cE)$ by
$\varepsilon(\alpha)$.
For any vector field $X$ on $M$, denote the contraction map induced
from the natural paring between $TM$ and $T^*M$ by 
$\tau(X):\cA^\bullet(M,\cE)\to
\cA^{\bullet-1}(M,\cE)$. Also denote the exterior differential
operator by $d:\cA^\bullet(M,\cE) \to \cA^{\bullet+1}(M,\cE)$. The
  following E.Cartan's homotopy formula is useful:
\[
\cL(X) = d\circ \tau(X) + \tau(X)\circ d.
\]
For any $X\in \fgg$ it induce a vector feild $X_M$ on $M$, we will
abuse the notation still call this vector feild $X$.

We will assume the group $G$ is a compact Lie group and $\cE$ is a
equivariant vector bundle with base space $M$ in the following part
of this notes. Let $n=\dim M$, $l = \dim M/2$.
For any differentail form $\alpha$ let $\alpha_{[n]}$ be the degree
$n$ part of this form. For Clifford algebra $C(V)$ over quadratic vector space,
let $\sigma_V\colon C(V) \to \bigwedge V$ be the symbol maps and 
$c \colon V \to C(V)$ be the natural embedding.

\section{Equivariant Index Theorem}
Here we assume $G$ action preserve the orientation and is isometric.
Hence induce a $G$ action on Clifford bundle $C(M)$, which $g$ act as algebra
automorphism. 

\begin{Def}
An \kw{equivariant Clifford module} $\cE$ over $M$ 
is an $G$-equivariant bundle, with a $\bZ_2$-grading, 
a Clifford module structure 
and Hermitian inner product preserved by group action.

The Dirac operator associated to a Clifford connection $\nabla^\cE$ on $\cE$
is given by ($c\colon \cA(M) \to C(M)$ is the qantization map)
\[
D = \sum_i c(dx^i)\nabla^\cE_{\partial_i}\colon \Gamma(M,\cE) \to \Gamma(M,\cE),
\]
which it is odd parity first order diffrential operator.
When $\Delta^\cE$ is $G$-invariant, $G$-action commutes with the Dirac operator.
So $\ker(D)$ becomes a $\bZ_2$-graded representation of $G$.
Define the \kw{equivariant index} to be the virtual charactor of this representation, that is 
\[
\ind_G(\gamma, D) = \Str(\gamma, \ker(D)) 
= \Tr(\gamma,\ker(D^+)) - \Tr(\gamma,\ker(D^-))\quad \forall \gamma\in G.
\]
\end{Def}

Now we have a generalization of the McKean-Singer formula
\begin{Prop}
Let $k_t(\gamma, x)|dx|=\brk{x|\gamma e^{-tD^2}|x}$ be the restriction of the
kernel of the operator $\gamma e^{-tD^2}$ to the 
diagonal. Then for $t>0$, 
\[
\ind_G(\gamma,D) = \Str(\gamma e^{-tD^2} = \int_M \Str(k_t(\gamma,x))|dx|.
\]
\end{Prop}

Observe that $k_t(\gamma,x) = \gamma^\cE_{\gamma^{-1}x}\brk{\gamma^{-1}x|e^{-tD^2}|x}$,
so when $t\to 0$, $k_t$ decay very fast if $\gamma^{-1}x \neq x$ and 
tends to the dirac measure on $x$ if $\gamma^{-1}x=x$.
Therefor we can expect the above integration will defend to integration
over the set fixed point. We will state the equivariant index theorem.

Denote the fixed point set of $\gamma$ by $M^\gamma$. It is a submainforld 
may have several components of different dimension. We have a orthonormal
decomposition
of tangent bundle $TM$ along $M^\gamma$ respect to the Riemannian metric as
\[
TM|_{M^\gamma} \cong T\Mr \oplus \cN
\]
where $\cN$ is the normal bundle along $\Mr$. 
Noticing that Levi-Civita connection preserves the decompositon, so 
induces connections of $T\Mr$ and $\cN$. Let $R^0$ and $R^1$ be the curvature
associated to these connections respectively. $R^0$ is the Riemannian curvature
of $M^\gamma$, 
hence $\Ah$-genus of $M^\gamma$ 
equals to $\det^{1/2}\left(\frac{R^0/2}{\sinh(R^0/2}\right)$.

Since the action of $\gamma$ on $\cE$ along $M^\gamma$ commuts with 
$c(\alpha)$ for $\alpha\in \Gamma(\Mr,T^*\Mr)$. $\gamma$ can view as a 
section $\gamma^\cE$ of $C(\cN^*)\otimes \End_{C(M)}(\cE)$.

Let $F_0^{\cE/\cS}\in \cA(M^\gamma,\End_{C(M)}(\cE))$ be the restriction of the twisteing curvature of
connection $\nabla^\cE$. 
\begin{Def}
Define the \kw{localized ralative Chern character} form
\[
\ch_G(\gamma, \cE/\cS) = \frac{2^{l_1}}{\det^{1/2}(1-\gamma_1)}
\Str_{\cE/\cS}(\sigma_{\cN}(\gamma^\cE)\exp(-F_0^{\cE/\cS})) \in \cA(M^\gamma,\det(\cN)).
\]
Here $\Str_{\cE/\cS}$ is the extension of usual supertrace to 
\[
\Str_{\cE/\cS}\colon \cA(\Mr, \End_{C(M)}(\cE)\otimes \det(\cN))
\to \cA(\Mr,\det(\cN)).
\]
$l_1 = \dim(\cN)$ is a locally constant function on $\Mr$. 
\end{Def}

Let $T_M\colon \Gamma(\Mr, \bigwedge T^*M) \to C^{\infty}(\Mr)$ be the 
Berezin integral. Denote the $\gamma$ action on $\cN$ be $\gamma_1$.

We have following form of equivariant index theorem.
\begin{Thm}[Atiyah-Segal-Singer]
The equivariant index $\ind_G(\gamma,D)$ of an equivariant Dirac operator $D$
associated to an ordinary connection satisfy the following formula:
\[
\int_G(\gamma, D) = i^{-\dim M/2}\int_{\Mr}(2\pi)^{-\dim \Mr/2} T_M
\left(\frac{\Ah(\Mr)\ch_G(\gamma,\cE/\cS)}{\det^{1/2}
(1-\gamma_1\exp(-R^1)}\right).
\]
\end{Thm}

\section{Equivariant Cohomology}

Consdier the space $\bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M,\cE)$, which is the space of polynomial maps from $\fgg$ to $\cA(M,\cE)$. View this space as a $G$-space by action
\[
(g\cdot \alpha)(X) = g\cdot (\alpha (g^{-1}\cdot X)) \quad \forall g\in G,
X\ in \fgg, \alpha \in \bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M,\cE).
\]
Give a $\bZ$-grading of this space by 
\[
\deg(P\otimes \alpha) = 2\deg(P)+\deg(\alpha), 
\quad \forall P\in \bC[\fgg], \alpha \in \cA(M,\cE)
\]

\begin{Def}
Let 
\[
\cA_G(M,\cE) = \left(\bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M,\cE)\right)^G
\]
be the $G$-invariant subspace of $\bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M,\cE)$, vectors in this space called equivariant differential forms with value in $\cE$.

Define operator $\dg$ on $\bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M,\cE)$ by
\[
\dg \alpha(X) = d(\alpha(X)) - \tau(X)(\alpha(X)).
\]
It can be show that $\dg$ increase the degree by one and restrict on 
$\cAg(M)$ we have $\dg^2= 0$. Hence we can define
the equivariant cohomology $H_G^*(M)$ to be the cohomology of complex $\left(\cAg(M),\dg\right)$.
\end{Def}

\begin{Rmk}
By homotopy formula,
\[
(\dg^2 \alpha)(X) = - \cL(X)\alpha(X)\quad \forall \alpha
\in \bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M)
\]
The infinitesimal condition to define a $G$-equivariant form is 
\[
\cL(Y)\alpha(X) - \alpha([Y,X]) = 0 \quad \forall X,Y \in \fgg.
\]
Hence $\dg^2 = 0$ on $\cAg(M)$.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Def}
Suppose a superbundle $\cE = \cE^+\oplus \cE^-$ 
with both even and odd part are $G$-equvariant.
A superconnection on $\cE$ called $G$-invariant if 
\[
[\bA,\cL^\cE(X)]=0.
\]
The equivariant superconnection $\bAg$ is the operator given by 
\[
(\bAg \alpha)(X) = (\bA-\tau(X))(\alpha(X)) \quad \forall  \bC[\fgg]\otimes \cA(M,\cE).
\]
It satisfies \[
\bAg(\alpha\wedge \theta) = \dg \alpha \wedge \theta +
(-1)^{|\alpha|}\alpha\wedge \bAg\theta \quad \forall\alpha \in \cA(M),
\theta \in \cA(M,\cE).
\]
Define the \kw{equivariant curvature} $\Fg$ by
\[
\varepsilon(\Fg(X))\alpha(X) = \bAg^2\alpha(X) + \cL^\cE(X)\alpha(X),
\] 
which can be show is in $\cAg^+(M,\End(\cE))$.
Moreover the \kw{equivariant Bianchi formula} holds:
\[
\bAg\Fg \triangleq [\bAg,\varepsilon(\Fg)] = 0.
\]
Define the \kw{moment} of $X\in \fgg$ by 
\[
\mu(X) = \cLE(X) - [\tau(X),\bA] = \Fg(X) - F \in \cAg^+(M,\End(\cE)),
\]
where $F = \bA^2$ is the usual curvature for superconnection $\bA$.

If $f(z)$ is a polynomial in the indeterminate $z$, we define an
\kw{equivariant characteristic form} by taking supertrace,
i.e. $\Str(f(\Fg)) \in \cAg^+(M)$. In paticular, we have
\kw{equivariant Chern character} 
\[\chg(\bA) = \Str(\exp(-\Fg))
\]
 and
\kw{equivariant $\Ah$-genus} 
\[
\Ahg(\nabla)(X) =
{\det}^{1/2}\left(\frac{\Fg(X)/2}{\sinh(\Fg(X)/2)}\right)
\]
for $G$-equvariant connection $\nabla$.
\end{Def}

\begin{Rmk}
We extend $\cL^\cE(X)$ to act on $\cA(M,\cE)$ by 
\[
\cLE(X)(\alpha\wedge \theta) =\cL(X) \alpha \wedge \theta +\alpha
\wedge \cLE(X)\theta \quad \forall \alpha\in \cA(M), \theta\in \cA(M,\cE).
\]

As in the non-equivariant case, we have $\Str(f(\Fg))$ is
equivariantly closed, i.e. $\dg \Str(f(\Fg)) = 0$ and its equivariant
cohomology class is independent of the choice of the $G$-invariant
superconnection $\bA$.
\end{Rmk}


\subsection{symplectic manifold}
A symplectic manifold is a manifold $M$ with symplectic two form
$\Omega$, where $\Omega\in \cA^2(M)$ such that $d\Omega=0$ and
the bilinear form $\Omega_x(X,Y)$ on $T_xM$ is non-degenerate.
For any $f\in C^\infty(M)$ one can define the \kw{Hamiltonian vector
  field} generated by $f$ by 
\[
df = \tau(H_f)\Omega.
\] 
$G$ acts on $M$ Hamiltonian means that there is a $G$-equivariant linear
map $\mu:\fgg\to C^\infty(M)$ such that 
\[
d\mu(X) = \tau(X) \Omega \quad \forall X\in \fgg.
\]
One define the \kw{symplectic moment map} of the action be the
$C^\infty$ map $\mu\colon M\to \fgg^*$ defined by $(X,\mu(m)) =
\mu(X)(m)$.

Call the volume form 
\[
d\beta=(e^{\Omega/2\pi})_[n] = \frac{\Omega^l}{(2\pi)^ll!}
\] 
on $M$ \kw{Liouville form}.

\subsection{Coadjoint Orbit}\label{Sec:co1}
The most importent example of symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian $G$
action is the Coadjoint Orbit. 
Let $\fgg^*$ be the dual vector space to the vector space of Lie
algebra $\fgg$ of $G$. $G$ act on $\fgg$ by adjoint action and on
$\fgg^*$ by corresponding dual action.

Let $M=M_\lambda$ be an orbit of coadjoint represention of $G$ on
$\fgg^*$ contains $\lambda \in \fgg^*$, i.e $M = G\cdot \lambda\cong
G/G_\lambda$, where $G_\lambda$ is the isotropy subgroup at $\lambda$.

Define the moment map $\mu(X)\colon M \to \bC$ by the evaluation map
$\mu(X)(f) = f(X)$ for $f\in M \subset \fgg^*$.
Define a $2$-form by $\Omega(X_M,Y_M)_f =-
f([X,Y])$. Note that the vector feild generated by $\fgg$ span the
tangent space at every point in $M$, so it is sufficient to define and
check the properties only for vector feilds generated by $\fgg$. It can be show this form is well defined non-degenerate on
$M$.
Moreover 
\[
\begin{split}
d\mu(X)(Y_M)_f  =& \ddt \mu(X)(\exp(-tY)f) =  \ddt(\exp(-tY)f)(X) \\
=&
\ddt f(\exp(tY)\cdot X) = f([Y,X]) = \Omega(X_M,Y_M).
\end{split}
\]
By 
\[
0 = d^2\mu(X) = d\tau(X_M)\Omega = -\tau(X_M) d\Omega
\] ($\cL(X_M)\Omega=0$), $d\Omega=0$.
Hence, $\Omega$ is the symplectic form one $M$ and $G$ act on $M$
Hamiltonian with symplectic moment map $\mu$.



\subsection{The Localization Formula}
By using a equivariant Riemannian metric $(\,,\,)$ on $M$ (which is always exist
in our case since $G$ is compact). 
Let $M_0(X)$ be the set of zero of vector field $X_M$ for $X\in \fgg$.
One can show that 
\begin{Prop}
Let $\alpha$ be an equivariantly closed differential form on $M$. 
Then $\alpha(X)_{[n]}$ $M_0(X)$ is exact outside $M_0(X)$.
\end{Prop}
\sproof 
Define one form $\theta$ by $\theta(\xi) = (X_M, \xi)$. 
Then $d_X^2 \theta  = -\cL(X)\theta  = 0$ and $d_X\theta  = |X|^2 + d\theta$ is
invertable outside $M_0(M)$. 
Let $\beta$ defined by $ d_X\theta \wedge \beta = \theta \wedge \alpha(X)$ outside $M_0(M)$.
Note that $d_X^2 \theta=0$ and $d_X\alpha(X) = 0$, we have
\[
d_X\theta \wedge \alpha(X) = 
d_X(d_X\theta \wedge \beta) = d_X\theta \wedge d_X\beta.
\]
So 
\[
\alpha(X) = d_X(\beta) = d_X\left(\frac{\theta\wedge \alpha(X)}{d_X\theta}\right).
\]
Read the above result of highest degree piece of each side, we have
\[
\alpha(X)_{[n]} = d\left(\frac{\theta\wedge \alpha(X)}{d_X\theta}\right)_{[n-1]}.
\] \qed

From the above result, it is tempting to reduce the integration
$\int_M\alpha(X)$ to a integration over $M_0(X)$, the set of zeroes $X_M$.
%%In general, this will be subtle since $M_0(X)$ may not even be a manifold. 

Let us consider the simplest but important case, $M_0(X)$ is a set of
isolated points.
For any point $p\in M_0(X)$,
$\cL(X)\xi = [X_M,\xi]$ will gives rise to a linear
transformation $L_p$ of $T_pM$ since 
\[\cL(X)(f\xi) = (X(f))\xi + f\cL(X)\xi = f\cL(X)\xi \quad \forall \xi
\in \Gamma(M,TM), f\in C^\infty(M).
\]. This linear transformation is invertible, because if $\xi\in T_pM$ is
annihilated by $L_p$ all the  points on the curve $\exp_p(s\xi)$ will
be fiexed by $\exp(tX)$ which contridict to  $p$ is an isolated point
in $M_0(X)$.
Since $G$ is compact, $L_p\in SO(n)$ by choosing a $G$-invariant
metric on $T_pM$. Now $\det^{1/2} (L_p)$ make sense.

Now we have the Localization formula for isolated zeroes.
  
\begin{Thm}
Let $\alpha$ be an equivariantly closed differential form
  on $M$. Assume $X_M$ has only isolated zeros. Then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:localization}
\int_M \alpha(X) = (-2\pi)^{\dim(M)/2}\sum_{p\in M_0(X)}\frac{\alpha(X)(p)}{\det^{1/2}(L_p)},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(X)(p)$ means the value of the function $\alpha(X)_{[0]}$
at point $p\in M$.
\end{Thm}

\subsection{The Fourier Transform of Coadjoint Orbits}
We follow the notation in Section~\ref{Sec:co1}.
For any coadjoint orbit $M$, we define the Fourier transform of an orbit
by 
\[
F_M(X) = \int_M e^{i f(X)}d\beta = (2\pi i )^{-l}\int_Me^{i\Omega_\fgg(X)}, 
\]
where $\Omega_\fgg(X) = \mu(X) + \Omega$ is a equivariantly closed form.
%Above may not make sence when $M$ is not sufficiently well-behaved.
%%can be realized as a equivariant curvi 

Now assume $G$ is connected compact Lie group.
Fix a Cartan subalgebra $\ftt$ in $\fgg$ so that $\fgg=\ftt\oplus \frr$ (where $\frr = [\ftt,\fgg]$ is the span of roots of $\ftt$). Let $T = Z_G(\ftt)$ be the corresponding Cartan subgroup. Denote the root system by $\Delta \subset \ftt^* \subset \ftt_\bC^*$ (In fact, all the roots take purly imaginary value on $\ftt$).
Let $W = N_G(T)/T$ be the Weyl group which can be identified with the algebric Weyl group $W(\fgg_\bC,\ftt_\bC)$ generated by simple reflection $s_\alpha$ on $\ftt_\bC$. 
For any root $\alpha\in \Delta$ pick $H_\alpha \in i\ftt$ such that $\inn{\alpha}{H_\alpha}=2$.
%$X_\alpha \in \fgg_\alpha, {X_{\bC}}_{\alpha}\in {\fgg_{\bC}_{-\alpha}$ and $ H%_\alpha\in \ftt_\bC $ such that they form a $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\bC)$ system, i.e.% 
%$[H_\alpha, X_\alpha] = 2X_\alpha, [H_\alpha,X_{-\alpha}] = -2 X_\alpha$ and $[X_{}]$
For given $\lambda\in\ftt^*$,
let $P_\lambda = \Set{\alpha\in \Delta|\inn{\lambda}{iH_\alpha}>0}$.
In particularly, when$\lambda$ is regular, i.e. 
the isotropy subgroup $G(\lambda)$ of $\lambda$ is $T$ 
or equivalently the orbit $M_\lambda$ has maximal possible dimension (we define $X\in \ftt$ ragular in the similar way), $P_\lambda$ will give a positive system of the root system $\Delta$.

\begin{Thm}[Harish-Chandra]
For given $\lambda\in \ftt^*$, let $W_\lambda = \Set{w\in W|w\lambda = \lambda}$
be the subgroup of $W$ stabilize $\lambda$. For regular element $X\in \ftt$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
F_{M_\lambda}(X) = \sum_{w\in W/W_\lambda}\frac{e^{i\inn{w\lambda}{X}}}{
\prod_{\alpha\in P_\lambda}\inn{w\alpha}{X}}. 
\end{equation}
Especially, when $\lambda$ is regular, the denominator in above formula are 
all same up to sign $\sign(w) = (-1)^{l(w)}$( $l(w)$ is the length of $w$ in the sence to decompose $w$ into product of simple reflection)
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:harish1}
F_{M_\lambda}(X) = \frac{\sum_{w\in W} \sign(w)e^{i\inn{w\lambda}{X}}}{\prod_{\alpha\in P_\lambda}\inn{w\alpha}{X}}
\end{equation}
\end{Thm}
\sproof When $X$ is regular, the zero set of $Z_M$
(or equivlantly the fixed point of $\exp(tX)$ on $M_\lambda$ is exactly
the finite set 
\[
M_0(X) = \Set{w\lambda|w\in W/W_\lambda}.
\]
Let $\frr_{[i\alpha]}$ be the subspace of $\frr$ 
such that $X$ act on it by infinitesimal rotation with angle $i\alpha(X)$.
One can identify $\frr_\lambda = \sspan\Set{\frr_{[i\alpha]}|alpha \in P_\lambda}$ 
with $T_\lambda M$. So $\det^{1/2}(\cL(X)) = \prod_{\alpha\in P_\lambda}(i\alpha(X))$.
Now apply the localization Formula~(\ref{eq:localization}) 
to (\ref{eq:fourier}) one get the result.

\section{Kirillov Formula}
The right hand side of the Equation~(\ref{eq:harish1}) is very similar to 
Weyl Character Formula for irreducible representation of Compact Lie groups.
We will see the relations in soon.
