\section{locally compact abelian goups}

\subsection{}	
In this chapter, it is mainly about locally compact abelian groups ,
 on which we will most often no restrictive assumptions, 
but some our results is irrelevant unless $G$ is isomorphic to its dual.
All subsequent applications relating to one of the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $G$ is a vector space
$X$ finite dimension $k$ over a locally compact non discrete
\item $G$ has the form $X_A=X_K\otimes A_k$, where $A_k$ is the ring
  of a body adeles $k$ which can be either a body of algebraic
  numbers,
  or a body of algebraic functions of dimension $1$ over a finished, 
  and oh k X is a finite dimensional vector on It. 
\end{enumerate}
We refer to these cases
saying that $G$ is ``type in the local case'' in case(a), ``type
ade1ique'' in case (b);
 if $G$ is a local or adelique, 
it is isomorphic to its dual. 
Locally compact groups  locally will often notes additives.

$T$ mean the multiplicative group of complex numbers such as
$t\bar{t}=1$,
 a character of $G$ is a morphism of $G$ to $T$. If $G$ and $H$ 
are locally compact abelian groups abe1iens, a bicharacter of $G\times
H$ is the continuous fuction $f$ of  $G\times H$ to T such that,
 for all $y\in H$, $x \to f(x, y)$ is a character of $G$, for all 
$x\in G$, $y \to f(x,y)$ is a character of $H$.

	
The continuous function $f$ of $G$ to $T$ will be will be called a second
degree character of $G$ if the fuction 
\[
(x, y)\to \frac{f( x + y)}{f(x)f (y)}
\]
is a bicharacter of $G\times G$, or 
, which is the same, if $f$ satisfies the relationship
\[
f (x + y + z) f (x) f(y) f (z) = f(x + y) f (y + z) f (z + x)
\]
whenever $x, y, z$ in $G$.

	
We always denote $G^*$  the dual of $G$ (written additive too), 
and we write
$(x, x^*)$, for $X\in G$, $x^* \in G^*$, as the value on $x$
corresponding the character  $x^*$ of $G$.
We always identify $G$ with the double-dual $(G^*)^*$ of  $G$ such that
\[
\inn{x}{x^*} = \inn{x^*}{x}
\]
(it can made this identification such that
$\inn{x}{x^*} ={-x^*}{x}$ as well, and it would be even more
convenient 
in some respects, 
but this shock habits received too)
If $x\to x\alpha$ is a morphism from $G$ to $H$, its dual $\alpha^*$
is the morphism from $H^*$ to $G^*$ such that 
\[
\inn{x\alpha}{y^*}=\inn{x}{y^*\alpha^*}
\]
whenever $x\in G$,$y^*\in H^*$.

All bicharacter of $G\times H$ can be written uniquely in the form 
\[
f(x,y)=\inn{x}{y\alpha}=\inn{y}{x\alpha^*}
\]
where $\alpha$ is a morphism from $H$ to $G^*$, 
$\alpha^*\colon G\to H^*$ is the dual of $\alpha^*$.
If $G=H$, it is both necessary and sufficient that $f$ is symmetric 
in $x, y$, then we have $\alpha=\alpha^*$.
We say that the morphism $\alpha$ from $G$ to $G^*$ is {\it symmetric}. 
 
If $f$ is a character of second degree of $G$, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\frac{f(x+y)}{f(x)f(y)} = \inn{x}{y\rho},
\end{equation}
or $\rho=\rho(f)$ is a morphism, obviously symmetric, from $G$ to
$G^*$;
In expression $\ref{eq:1}$, we say that $f$ and $\rho$ are associated
to each other. If we denote $X_2(G)$  the multiplication group of 
characters of second degree on $G$, function $f\to \rho(f)$ is a
homomorphism from $X_2(G)$ to the additive group of symetric
morphisms from $G$ to $G^*$;
the kernal of this homomorphism is the multiplicative group $X_1(G)$
of characher on $G$.
We can say more in the case that $x\to 2x$ is an automorphism of $G$
 (which occurs for example if $G$ is local or on a body adelie k
 characteristics other than 2);
then, we denote $x\to 2^{-1}x$  the inverse of the automorphism $x\to
2x$ of $G$. In this case, if $\rho$ is a symetric morphism from $G$ to
$G^*$,
it is associated with the second degree character
 $f_\rho(x)=\inn{x}{2^{-1}x\rho}$; if we denote $X^0_2(G)$ the
 subgroup of $X_2(G)$ formed by $f_\rho$, then $X_2(G) =
 X^0_2(G)\times X_1(G)$, and $X^0_2(G)$ is isomorphic to the additive
 group of symetric morphisms from $G$ to $G^*$.

We say that the character of second degree $f$ is non {\it degenerate} 
if the symetric morphism associated with $f$ is a isomrophism from $G$ 
to $G^*$;the existance of such character is necessary (but not
sufficient) for $G$ isomorphic to $G^*$.

\subsection{}
Section 2

Given a Haar measure $dx$ on G, a Fourier transform $\mathfrak{T}$
is that we associate with each function $\Phi$ on $G$, a function
$\Phi^{*}=\mathfrak{T}(\Phi)$ on $G^{*}$ defined as \[
\Phi^{*}(x^{*})=\int\Phi(x)\cdot<x,x^{*}>\cdot dx\]


\noindent whenever this integral, or a suitable extension of it, makes
sense. Then there is a Haar measure $dx^{*}$ on $G^{*}$, called
the $dual$ of $dx$, such that the inverse transformation $\mathfrak{T}^{-1}$
of $\mathfrak{T}$ is given by the formula

\[
\Phi(x)=\int\Phi^{*}(x^{*})\cdot<x,-x^{*}>\cdot dx^{*};\]


For this measure, we have the Plancherel formula

\[
\int|\Phi(x)|^{2}dx=\int|\Phi^{*}(x^{*})|^{2}dx^{*}\]


It is clear that, for every $c>0$, the Haar measure on $G^{*}$,
dual of $c\cdot dx$, is $c^{-1}dx^{*}$. This remark can be expressed
as follows,

\begin{lemma}\label{l:1}
Let $G$, $H$ be two locally compact abelian groups,
with Haar measure $dx$, $dy$; let $G^*$, $H^*$ be their duals,
equipped with Haar measure $dx^*$, $dy^*$ respectively. Then,
if $\alpha$ is an isomorphism of $G$ on $H$, $\alpha^{*}$ is an
isomorphism of $H^{*}$ on $G^{*}$, and one has $|\alpha^{*}|=|\alpha|$.
\end{lemma}

Recall that, if $G$ and $H$ are locally compact groups (commutative
or not) with Haar measures, the module of an isomorphism $\alpha$
of $G$ on $H$ is the number $|\alpha|=d(x\alpha)/dx$ defined by
the formula

\[
\int F(y)dy=|\alpha|\cdot\int F(x\alpha)dx\]


where $F\in L^{1}(H)$; if $G=H$, it is generally understood that
we take $dx=dy$, and then $|\alpha|$ is independent of the choice
of $dx$. To prove the lemma, let $m=|\alpha|$; by transport of structure,
$\alpha$ transforms $dx$ into a Haar measure $d'y$ on $H$, and
as soon as we see that $d'y=m^{-1}dy$; it follows that $\alpha^{*}$transforms
the dual measure of $d'y$, which is, as noted above, $m\cdot dy^{*}$
into $dx^{*}$; thus $\alpha*$ transforms $dy^{*}$ into $m^{-1}dx^{*}$,
which shows the lemma.

\subsection{}
Let $x\to z\sigma$ is an automorphism of $G\times G^*$; if we set
$z=(x,x^*)$, we can also written in a matrix form:
\[
(x,x^*)\to (x,x^*)\cdot 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\alpha & \beta \\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}
\]
which means, of course:
\[
(x,x^*)\to (x\alpha + x^*\gamma,x\beta + x^*\delta)
\]
where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$ are morphisms from $G$ to
$G$,
from $G$ to $G^*$, from $G^*$ to $G$ and $G^*$ to $G^*$ respectively. 
Note that the dual $\sigma^*$ of the $G\times G^*$ automorphism
$\sigma$ 
is the automorphism defined by these formulas:
\[
\sigma^* \to \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha^* & \gamma^* \\
\beta^* & \delta^*
\end{pmatrix}
\]
on $G^*\times G$.
Let $\eta$ be the isomorphism $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ -1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$ 
from $G\times G^*$ to $G^*\times G$, or, it's the same, 
the isomorphism $(x,x^*)\to (-x^*, x)$ (we refer them as the same automorphism  for any groups.)  The forumla
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
\sigma^I = \eta \sigma^* \eta^I = 
\begin{pmatrix} \delta^* & - \beta^*\\-\gamma^* & \alpha^*\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
defines an automorphism of $G\times G^*$, and Lemma~\ref{l:1} of section~2
shows that $\abs{\sigma^I}=\abs{\sigma}$. 
Note that $\sigma\to \sigma^I$ is an anti-automorphism involution of the
group of automorphisms of $G\times G^*$.
For the convenience of writing,  we will denote $F$ the bicharacter of 
$(G\times G^*)\times (G\times G^*)$ defined by 
\[
F(z_1,z_2) = \inn{x_1}{x_2^*}\quad (z_1=(x_1,x_1^*), z_2=(x_2,x_2^*)
\] 
An automorphism $\sigma$ of $G\times G^*$ is called {\it symplectic} if
it lead invariant of the bicharacter $F(z_1,z_2)F(z_2,z_1)^{-1}$, i.e. if
you have 
\begin{equation}
\frac{F(z_1\sigma, z_2\sigma)}{F(z_2\sigma, z_1\sigma}= 
\frac{F(z_1, z_2)}{F(z_2,z_1)}.
\end{equation}
whenever $z_1$, $z_2$ in $G\times G^*$; we write $\Sp(G)$ as the group 
formed by these automorphisms. For $\sigma$ to be symplectic, 
it is both necessary and sufficiently (as shown by a calculation immediately) 
that $\sigma \sigma^I = 1$, $\sigma^I$ is defined by (\ref{eq:2});
$\abs{\sigma^I}=\abs{\sigma}$, it follows that the module of any symplectic 
automorphism is $1$. The relationship $\sigma \sigma^I=1$ gives 
$\alpha\beta^* = \beta\alpha^*$ and $\gamma \delta^*=\delta \gamma^*$ 
in particular, which means that $\alpha\beta^*$ and $\gamma \delta^*$
 are symmetric morphisms from $G$ to $G^*$ and from $G^*$ to $G$ respectively;
through the relationship $\sigma^I \sigma = 1$, we see that $\beta^*\delta$ and
$\gamma^*\alpha$ in the same way.

\subsection{}
For any element $w=(u,u^{*})$ of $G\times G^{*}$, we pick an operator
$U(w)$, which, for any function $\Phi$ on $G$, gives a function
$\Phi'=U(w)\Phi$ such that

\[
\Phi'(x)=(U(w)\Phi)(x)=\Phi(x+u)\cdot<x,u^{*}>\]


For short, we write $U(w)\Phi(x)$ instead of $(U(w)\Phi)(x)$. Applied
to functins $\Phi\in L^{2}(G)$, the $U(w)$ is obviously the unitary
operator, and it was, for any $w_{1},w_{2}$ in $G\times G^{*}$:

\[
U(w_{1})U(w_{2})=F(w_{1},w_{2})\cdot U(w_{1}+w_{2})\]


wherein $F$ is the function defined above by (3). It concludes that
the operators $t\cdot U(w)$, for $w\in G\times G^{*}$ and $t\in T$,
form a group, whose composition law is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
(w_{1},t_{1})\cdot(w_{2},t_{2})=(w_{1}+w_{2},F(w_{1},w_{2})t_{1}t_{2})
\end{equation}

In other words, the formula (\ref{eq:4}) defines a group law
 on the set $G\times G^{*}\times T$;
and if we denote by $A(G)$ the group thus defined (which, with the
obvious topology on $G\times G^{*}\times T$, is a locally compact
group), the mapping $(w,t)\rightarrow t\cdot U(w)$ defines a unitary
representation $A(G)$. We denote by $\mathbf{A}(G)$ the group formed
by the operators $t\cdot U(w)$; if we choose the topology induced
by the strong topology  in the
group of automorphisms of $L^{2}(G)$ (cf. later in Sectin 35), it
is easy to verify that $(w,t)\rightarrow t\cdot U(w)$ is even an
isomorphism of topological groups.

The center of the group $A(G)$ is obviously formed by the elements
$(0,t)$; it is isomorphic to $T$, and denoted $T$ for short. It
is clear that $(w,t)\rightarrow w$ is a homomorphism of $A(G)$ on
$G\times G^{*}$, with kernel $T$; it allows to identify $A(G)/T$
with $G\times G^{*}$.
\subsection{}
Let $B(G)$ be the automorphism group of $A(G)$. 
An automorphism $s$ in  $B(G)$ induce an automorphism of the center $T$ of 
 $A(G)$, which may not be t-> t or t-> i; 
and induced by passing to the quotient, an automorphism a $A(G)/T$, i.e. 
$G\times G^*$. We denoted $B_0(G)$ the automorphism group of $A(G)$, 
which induce the identity map on the center $T$ of $A(G)$.
We  consider $B_0(G)$ now, although the following results can partially 
coverte to $B(G)$. Let $s$ be an element of $B_0(G)$, which induced a 
automorphism $\sigma$ of $G\times G^*$. it is immediatly written $s$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
(w,t)s = (w\sigma, f(w)t),
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a continous function from $G\times G^*$ to $T$. 
This formula defines an automorphism of $A(G)$, it is necessary and sufficient 
that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
\frac{f(w_1+w_2)}{f(w_1)f(w_2)}=\frac{F(w_1\sigma, w_2\sigma)}{F(w_1,w_2)}
\end{equation}
where $w_1,w_2$ are in $G\times G^*$.
This shows in particular that $f$ 
is a character in the second degree of $G\times G^*$. 
Moreover,the second is symmetric in $w_1$ and $w_2$,
 we see that $\sigma$ must be symplectic.

Write $s = (\sigma, f)$ where $s$ is the automorphism of $A(G)$ defined by 
(\ref{eq:5}), $f$ and $\sigma$ satisfy the relation ($\ref{eq:6}$).
The group law is given by 
\[
(\sigma, f)\cdot(\sigma',f') = (\sigma\sigma', f'')
\]
for any $w\in G\times G^*$, $f$ is defined by the formula
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
f''(w)=f(w)f'(w\sigma)
\end{equation}
The map $s\to \sigma$ is a homomorphism from $B_0(G)$ to $\Sp(G)$;
its kernel is formed by  the elements $(1,f)$, where $f$, by (\ref{eq:6}),
is a character of $G\times G^*$ of the form 
\[
f(u,u^*) = \inn{u}{a^*}\inn{a}{u^*}
\]
with $a\in G$, $a^*\in G^*$. 	 	
But it immediately satisfies that $(1,f)$ is the inner
 automorphism of $A(G)$ determind by the element $(-a, a^*, 1)$. 
The kernel of $s\to \sigma$ formed by the inner automorphism of $A(G)$,
is isomorphic to $A(G)/T$, therefore, $G\times G^*$.

 	
We can go one step further by explaining the second term of (\ref{eq:6}).
Let $\sigma$ be placed in matrix form as in Section~$3$. Let
\[
f'(u,u^*)=f(u,u^*)\inn{u^*\gamma}{-u\beta}
\]
Easy calculation gives (\ref{eq:6}) in the form
\[
f'(u_1+u_2, u^*_1+u^*_2) = f'(u_1,u^*_1)f'(u_2,u^*_2)\inn{u_1}{u_2\alpha\beta^*}
\inn{u^*_1\gamma\delta^*}{u^*_2}.
\]
Let $g(u) = f'(u,0)$, $h(u^*)=f'(0,u^*)$; by $u_2=0$, $u_1^*=0$ in the relation
about, we see that $f'(u,u^*)$ is no other than $g(u)h(u^*)$, then $g$ and $h$
satisfy the relations
\begin{align*}
g(u_1+u_2)&=g(u_1)g(u_2)\inn{u_1}{u_2\alpha\beta^*}\\
h(u^*_1+u^*_2)&=h(u^*_1)g(u^*_2)\inn{u^*_1\gamma\delta^*}{u^*_2},
\end{align*}
in other words they are the characters of second degree of $G$ and $G^*$,
respectively associated with symmetric morphisms $\alpha\beta^*$, 
$\gamma\delta^*$ from $G$ to $G^*$ and $G^*$ to $G$. Then:
\[
f(u,u^*)=g(u)h(u^*)\inn{u^*\gamma}{u\beta}.
\]
	
It of course has more accurate results when $x-> 2x$ is an automorphism of $G$.
In view of Subsection~1, above formulas show that,
 for all symplecitc automorphism $\sigma$, it correspond to an element 
$(\sigma, f)$ of $B_0(G)$, obtained by
\[
g(u)=\inn{u}{2^{-1}u\alpha\beta^*}, h(u^*)=\inn{2^{-1}u^*\gamma\delta^*}{u^*}.
\]
	
Furthermore, these formulas define a monomorphisme from $\Sp(G)$ to $B_0(G)$, 
and $B_0(G)$ is the semidirect product of the image of $\Sp(G)$ by this map 
and the inner automorphisms of $A(G)$; consequently, 
$B_0(G)$ is isomorphic to a semidirect product of $Sp (G)$ and  $G\times G^*$.

\subsection{}

\subsection{}
Now agree, for $s=(\sigma, f)$ and 
$\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}\alpha &\beta \\ \gamma &\delta
\end{pmatrix}$, 
put $\gamma = \gamma(s)$; and denote $\Omega_0(G)$  all the $s\in B_0(G)$
such that $\gamma(s)$ is an isomorphism from $G^*$ to $G$
(this set can be empty).
It has the following result:
\begin{prop}\label{p:1}
These set $\Omega_0(G)$ of $s\in B_0(G)$ such that $\gamma(s)$ is an 
isomorphism from $G^*$ to $G$ is the set of elements of $B_0(G)$  of the forme 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
s = t_0(f_1)d'_0(\gamma)t_0(f_2)
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is a isomorphism from $G^*$ to $G$ and $f_1$, $f_2$ are 
characters of second degree for $G$;
and any element of $\Omega_0(G)$ has unique decomposition in that form.  
\end{prop}
if $s$ is given by (\ref{eq:8}), $\gamma(s)=\gamma$, then 
$s$ is in $\Omega_0(G)$.
Conversely, let $s =(\sigma, f) \in  \Omega_0(G)$; if (\ref{eq:8}) holds, 
we must take $\gamma=\gamma(s)$. Then let 
$\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}\alpha &\beta \\ \gamma &\delta \end{pmatrix}$; easy 
calculation shows that (\ref{eq:8}) is satisfied, 
it is necessary and sufficient that 
\[
f_1(u)=f(u,-u\alpha\gamma^{-1}), \quad f_2(u)=f(0,u\gamma^{-1}).
\]
These demonstrated by  the proposition. 
Note that applying (\ref{eq:8}) the homomorphism
$s\to \sigma$, by the relation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\alpha &\beta \\ \gamma &\delta \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
1 & \alpha\gamma^{-1}\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -\gamma^{*-1}\\
\gamma & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \gamma^{-1}\delta\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix};
\]
because of the symplectic of $\sigma$, $\alpha\gamma^{-1}$ and $\gamma^{-1}\delta$
are symmetric morphisms from $G$ to $G^*$; they are associated with
 $f_1$ and $f_2$ respectively.

 	
This gives a important relationship by considering a second degree character $f$
which is non degenerated of $G$, 	
this means that the morphism $\rho$ associated with $f$ is an isomorphism
from $G$ to $G^*$; then the function $f'$ to $G^*$, defined by 
\[
f'(x^*) = f(-x^*\rho^{-1}),
\]
is a character of second degree of $G^*$, with the associated symmetric 
morphism $\rho^{-1}$ from $G^*$ to $G$. 
By the proposition~\ref{p:1}, applied to $t'_0(f')$, gives
\[
t'(f')=t_0(f)d'_0(\rho^{-1})t_0(f^-)
\]
where $f^-$ is defined by $f^-(x)=f(-x)$ 	
as mentioned above.
A simple calculation gives the other:
\[
t'_0(f') = d'_0(\rho^{-1})t_0(f^{-1})d'_0(-\rho^{-1}).
\]
At the same time we have $d'_0(\rho^{-1})^2=d_0(-1)$, we derived the following:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:9}
d'_0(-\rho^{-1})t_0(f)d'_0(\rho^{-1})t_0(f^-)= t_0(f^{-1})d'_0(-\rho^{-1}).
\end{equation}
Taking into account the relationships obtained in subsection~6, 
we have (\ref{eq:9}) in a simpler form
\[
(t_0(f)d'_0(-\rho_0^{-1}))^3=e,
\] 
where $e$ is the identity element of $B_0(G)$; in that form, 
it is well known in the theory classic modular group.
But it is the relationship (9), as written above, we have to use later.

\subsection{}

\subsection{}
Now let $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ are two functions on $G\times G^*$, 	
temporarily assume that continues a compact support; after (\ref{eq:10}),
we have
\[
U(\phi_1)U(\phi_2) = U(\phi_3)
\]
where $\phi_3$ is given by the formula 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:13}
\phi_3(w) = \int \phi_1(w-w_1)\phi_2(w_1)F(w-w_1,w_1) dw_1;
\end{equation}
as before, $F$ denot the function defined here by (\ref{eq:3}) subsection~3.
If we let $K_i=W(\phi_i)$ for $i = 1, 2, 3,$ (\ref{eq:11}) shows that $K_3$
 is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:14}
K_3(x,y)=\int K_1(x,z)K_2(z,y)dz
\end{equation}
we write $K_3 = K_1\times K 2$.
Moreover, the above formulas are extended by continuity 
to the space $L^2(G\times G^*)$, $L^2 (G\times G)$.
We will need the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{l:2}
Let $K\in L^2(G\times G)$; K is in the form $P\otimes Q$, 
with $P$ and $Q$ in $L^2(G)$, 
it is both necessary and sufficient that for any $K'\in L^2(G\times G)$,
$K x K' x K$ and $K$ differs by a scalar factor.
Let $K = P\otimes Q$, $K'= P'\otimes Q'$, with $P, Q, P', Q '$in $L^2(G)$;
for P and P '(resp. Q and Q ') 	
no different from another by a scalar factor, 
it is both necessary and sufficient that for any
$K''=P''\otimes Q''$ with $P''$ and $Q''$ in $L^2(G)$, $K\times K''$
 and $K'\times K''$ (resp. $K''\times K$ and $K''\times K'$) 
are different by a scalar factor.
\end{lemma}
	 	
The second part is obvious, and it is evident that in the first part, 
the required condition is necessary;
to see that it is sufficient, simply apply to the case $K'= P'\otimes Q'$. 
The only consequence of this lemma we need is the following:
\begin{lemma}\label{l:3}
Let $K\to K^s$ an an automorphism of Hilbert space $L^2(G\times G)$
with composition $(K_1,K_2) \to K_1\times K_2$ defined by (\ref{eq:14}).
So there is an automorphism $t$ of  $L^2(G)$ such that, for all $P$ and $Q$ in
$L^2(G)$, $(P\otimes Q)^s = P^t \otimes Q^{\overline{t}}$, 
and $\overline{t}$ is the imaginary conjugation of  $t$, defined by 
$\overline{Q}^{\overline{t}}= (\overline{Q^t})$.
\end{lemma}
Indeed, after Lemma 2, any element $(Q\otimes P)^s$ of $L^2(G\times G)$
 is of the form $P'\otimes Q'$. Choose $P_0$ as $\norm{P_0}=1$; 
then $s$ conserve the norm, we can put 
$(P_0\otimes \overline{P}_0)^s$ in the form $P'_0\otimes Q'_0$ 
with $\norm{P'_0}=\norm{Q'_0}=1$. 	
The second part of lemma 2 shows, whenever $P,Q$ in $L^2(G)$
$(P\otimes \overline{P}_0)^s$ and $(P+0\otimes Q)^s$ are, respectively,
has unique form $P'\otimes Q'_0$ and $P'_0\otimes Q'$. 
If describes $P'= P^t$, $Q'= Q^u$, it is clear that $t, u$ are linear maps
from $L^2(G)$ to $L^2(G)$ and $p^t_0 = P'_0$, $\overline{P}^u_0=Q'_0$;
$s$ preserve the norm of $L^2(G\times G)$, 	
it is the same as $t$ and $u$ in $L^2(G)$.
As we have $P\otimes Q = (P\otimes \overline{P}_0)\times (P_0\otimes Q)$,
it follows that $(P\otimes Q)^s=c\cdot P^t\otimes Q^u$, 
and $c=(P'_0, \overline{Q}'_0)$; for $P=P_0$, $Q=Q_0$, it gives $c=1$.
As 
\[
(P\otimes Q)\times (P\otimes Q) = (P,\overline{Q})P\otimes Q,
\]
we see that for $P'= P^t$, $Q'=Q^u$, $(P',\overline{Q}')=(P,\overline{Q})$;
it follows that $u=\overline{t}$. 
Finally, since
$s^{-1}$ has the same properties as $s$, $t$ and $u$ are invertible and
 are therefore automorphism of $L^2(G)$.
