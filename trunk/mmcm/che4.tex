\begin{Exec}
  Show that $\text{SO(3)}$ is homeomorphic
  to three-dimensional real projective space.

\section{E. Noether's theorem}


\begin{Exec}
  Suppose that a particle moves in the field of the uniform 
  helical line $x = \cos\phi$, $y = \sin\phi$, $z = c\phi$. 
  Find the law of conservation corresponding to this helical symetry.
\end{Exec}

\begin{solution}
  任一质点若容许在螺线上运动, 且$L$在其上不变于是有容许映射$h$,
  设$\bx = (\cos \phi,\sin\phi, c\phi)$.
  则$h^s \bx = (\cos(\phi+s),\sin(\phi+s), c(\phi+s))$.
  于是
  $$dh^s\bx/ds \vat_{s = 0} = (-\sin\phi,\cos\phi,c) = (-y,x,c)$$.
  又$M_3 = ([\bx,m\bxd],\be_3)= (m\bx,[\bx,\be_3])
   = (m(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}),[(x,y,z),(0,0,1)]) 
   = -m\dot{x}y + m\dot{y}x$
  于是$I = m \dot{z} c + m \dot{x}(-y) + m \dot{y}x 
  = cP_3+M_3$守恒.
\end{solution}

\begin{Exec}
  Suppose that a rigid body is moving under its own inertia. Show that its
  center of mass moves linearly and uniformly. If the center of mass is 
  at rest, then the angular momentum with repect to its is conserved
\end{Exec}

\begin{proof}
  
\end{proof}

\begin{Exec}
  What quantity is conserved under the motion of a heavy rigid body if it is
  fixed at some point $O$? What if, in addition, the body is symmetric 
  with respect to an axis passing through $O$?
\end{Exec}

\begin{Exec}
  Extend Noether's theorem to non-autonomous lagrangian systems.
\end{Exec}

\begin{solution}
  令$M_1 = M\times \bR$为拓广的构形空间.
  定义函数$L_1:TM_1\rightarrow \bR$为$L\frac{dt}{d\tau}$.
  局部坐标下:
  $$L_1\left(\bq,t,\frac{d\bq}{d\tau},\frac{dt}{d\tau}\right)
  = L\left(\bq,\frac{d\bq/d\tau}{dt/d\tau},t)dt\right)$$,
  
  
\end{solution}
