  abstract = {{[For the entire collection see Zbl 0694.00012.] \par This paper considers
	the notion of functoriality for the correspondence given by the oscillator
	representation for a dual reductive pair $(G,G')$ in Sp(2n,${\bbfR})$,
	assuming the oscillator representation factors to $G\times G'.$ \par
	There are counterexamples to the obvious conjecture in terms of L-
	packets, so the author proposes using the larger packets called Arthur-
	packets. These packets are parametrized by admissible maps $\Psi$
	: $W\sb R\times SL(2,{\bbfC})\to\sp LG$. The conjecture is that given
	$G,G'$, there is (after possibly exchanging $G,G')$ a map $\gamma$
	: ${}\sp LG\to\sp LG'$ and a fixed homomorphism T: SL(2,${\bbfC})\to\sp
	LG'$, which describe the correspondence. \par The conjecture states
	that if a representation $\pi$ occurring in the correspondence is
	in the Arthur-packet determined by $\Psi$, then its image $\pi '$
	is in the Arthur-packet determined by $\Psi '(w,g)=\gamma \circ \Psi
	(w,g)T(g)$. The author proves this conjecture in many cases, showing
	it to be consistent with all known examples. There is also a conjecture
	concerning the correspondence not just between G and $G'$ but between
	all their inner forms.}},

	on Rn, through the Calder-Vaillancourt (0, 0) L2-estimate, as a natural
	part of the harmonic analysis on the Heisenberg group, the group-theoretic
	embodiment of Heisenberg's Canonical Commutation Relations. The symbol
	mapping is given a group-theoretic interpretation consistent with
	the Kirillov method of orbits. By comparing different well-known
	realizations of the unique irreducible representation of the Heisenberg
	group, the Toeplitz operators on the complex n-ball are shown essentially
	to be pseudo-differential operators. The proof of the Calder-Vaillancourt
	estimate is almost purely group-theoretic. Criteria for positivity,
	and for compactness are also given.},

	of K is shown to be equivalent to a subquotient of a representation

	It follows that π integrates to a continuous irreducible Hilbert

	multiplicity of any finite-dimensional irreducible representation

	of Harish-Chandra, R. Godement and J. Dixmier. The representations

	class of an infinitesimal composition series for the representation,
	generalizing a theorem of N. Wallach. The composition series of Weyl-group-related

	to be equivalent. An expression is given for the infinitesimal spherical
	functions associated with the nonunitary principal series. In several

	precisely, between the ones of the inverse images $\tilde G'$ resp.

	This paper analyses this local theta lifting between discrete series
	representations of $\tilde G'$ and unitary representations of $\tilde

	in the case of irreducible type I reductive dual pairs that if the

	determine this correspondence explicitly for dual pairs of the form
	(U(p,q),U(r,s)) withr+s=p+q, and describe it in terms of Langlands
	parameters. In this case, the correspondence may be understood in
	a natural way as a correspondence of representations of the linear
	groups, rather than the appropriate covers. We show that every irreducible
	admissible representation ofU(p,q) occurs in the correspondence with
	precisely one unitary group of equal rank. This result verifies a
	conjecture of Harris, Kudla, and Sweet, who investigated the correspondence
	for unitary groups of equal size overp-adic fields. The correspondence
	of discrete series representations was determined by J.-S. Li. For
	induced representations, the correspondence is obtained in a natural
	way from the corresponding discrete series on the respective Levi
	factors of the parabolic subgroups ofU(p,q) andU(r,s). Generalizing
	a result of Li, we show that under the correspondence representations
	with nonzero cohomology are matched in an interesting way, with unitarity
	not necessarily preserved. The proof uses the induction principle
	which is due to Kudla, and an argument involvingK-types and the space
	of joint harmonics (Howe).},

  abstract = {A graded generalization of Lie triples is defined such that the well-known
	relations between Lie triples and Lie algebras remain valid. For
	instance, the graded generalizations of Lie algebras, considered
	recently in physics and mathematics, become such triples with respect
	to the graded double commutator, and every such triple can be constructed
	by means of an involutive automorphism of degree zero on such an
	algebra as eigenspace of eigenvalue -1. In case of a Z2-graduation
	there is an elementary example, considered first in the second quantization
	in quantum field theory, which is constructed on a graded vector
	space V with a graded symmetric bilinear form <, >. This triple has
	a realization in the Clifford algebra constructed over (V, <, >).
	An elementary construction of representations which in the (Lie)
	group case leads to inhomogenizations and tangent groups can be generalized
	to these triples as well.},

  abstract = {The first part of this paper deals with problems concerning the symmetric
	algebra of complex-valued polynomial functions on the complex vector
	space of n by k matrices. In this context, a generalization of the
	so-called "classical separation of variables theorem" for the symmetric
	algebra is obtained. The second part is devoted to the study of certain
	linear representations, on the above linear space (the symmetric
	algebra) and its subspaces, of the complex general linear group of
	order k and of its subgroups, namely, the unitary group, and the
	real and complex special orthogonal groups. The results of the first
	part lead to generalizations of several well-known theorems in the
	theory of group representations. The above representation, of the
	real special orthogonal group, which arises from the right action
	of this group on the underlying vector space (of the symmetric algebra)
	of matrices, possesses interesting properties when restricted to
	the Stiefel manifold. The latter is defined as the orbit (under the
	action of the real special orthogonal group) of the n by k matrix
	formed by the first n row vectors of the canonical basis of the k-dimensional
	real Euclidean space. Thus the last part of this paper is involved
	with questions in harmonic analysis on this Stiefel manifold. In
	particular, an interesting orthogonal decomposition of the complex
	Hilbert space consisting of all square-integrable functions on the
	Stiefel manifold is also obtained.},

	subgroups, and representations of reductive groups (1980; Zbl 0443.22010),
	see p. 223] relates this problem to computations of cohomology of
	infinite-dimensional representations of the corresponding semisimple
	group. More precisely, the problem is the following: Suppose G is
	a reductive Lie group with Lie algebra ${\frak g}$ and maximal compact
	subgroup K. Find all unitary irreducible representations $\pi$ such
	that (*) $H\sp*({\frak g},K,\pi)\ne 0$ or more generally $H\sp*({\frak

	paper under review describes all Harish-Chandra modules satisfying
	(*). The results are sharp in the sense that $\pi$ and $H\sp*({\frak

	is obtained by what is known as the ``derived functors construction''
