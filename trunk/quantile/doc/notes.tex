\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}


\cite{Hull2008} defines an {\it option} to be a contract which provides the holder the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at or before a certain date at an predetermined price. The price determined in the contract is called the {\it strike price}. To get this right, the buyer should pay the seller. Every option contract involves tow sides of investors. One side is known as the long side. On the long side is the investor who has bought the option.  Another side is called the short position who has sold the option. If the long side chooses to exercise the right defined in the contract, the short side has the obligation to perform the transaction with the long side at the specified price set in the contract. Since there exists a disparity of right and obligation, the long side should pay a premium to the short side to obtain this right. However, this contract is only in effect before certain date. This date set in the contract is called {\it expiration date} or {\it maturity}. Basically, there are two types of option contracts. A holder of a {\it call} option has the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price, while a holder of a {\it put} option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the predetermined price. European options can be exercised only at the expiration date. American options on the other hand can be exercised at any time before the expiration date.

To help the understanding of options, here we give an example of the use of an option. Suppose that it is now January 15. A copper fabricator expects it will need 100,000 pounds of copper on May 15 to meet a certain contract. The spot price of copper is 140 cents per pound. To fix the expense of raw material, the fabricator may take a long position of a call option, for example, a call option with a strike price of \$120,000 for 100,000 pounds of copper expired in four month. Holding this option, the fabricator eliminates its risk exposure to the changes of copper price. This example is using an option as a hedging instrument. There are other purposes of using of options.

Generally, there are three broad categories of traders of options: {\it hedgers}, {\it speculators}, and {\it arbitrageurs}. Hedgers are the group of investors who use options to reduce the risk associated with potential future movements of the price for a certain asset. Speculators bet on the future direction of an asset using options. Taking advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two different markets, arbitrageurs lock in risk-free profits by concurrently taking offsetting positions in two or more markets. One main reason contributing to the success of option markets is that they meet the needs of different types of traders.

Options have a long history. There is evidence that Romans and Phoenicians used similar contracts in shipping. In ancient Greece, a famous mathematician and philosopher, Thales, used options to obtain a low price for olive presses ahead of the harvest. In the 17th century the Dutch bought and sold options structured on tulip. However, the trading of options actually took off in the 1970s. The Chicago Board of Trade established the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and began trading listed call options on 16 stocks on April 26, 1973. From then, innovation has bred the creation of copious products tailored to meet the needs of different types of investors. Exotic options, such as Asian options, barrier options and lookback options are traded routinely. One common character of these exotic options is that they are usually path-dependent. 
Recently, even more exotic types of options such as Parisian options and ${\alpha}$-quantile options have appeared and attracted interest. Although exotic options are a relatively small part of financial market in terms of volume, these options are important to investment banks because they are generally much more profitable than plain vanilla options.

Options are bought and sold in two ways. Options with standardized terms are traded on organized exchanges. These kinds of options are more standard and liquid than over-the-counter options. Over-the-counter options are not listed in exchanges and instead are only quoted by financial institutions. According to the statistics published by Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' central bank, in June $2009$, the amounts outstanding of options traded in organized exchanges were $\$43.75$ trillion and the figure for over-the-counter options is $\$68.19$ trillion.

The prosperity of option markets calls for valuation methods of options. While in return, the success of pricing model also boosts the development of options. In Chapter $2$, we review the fundamental pricing principles for both European and American options. Popular numerical methods are surveyed in Chapter $3$. In Chapter $4$, we give an extensive study of quantiles of Brownian motion and quantile options. This is the main focus in this thesis.

\chapter{Principles of option pricing}

% add more Brodie option pricing: valuation models and applications and the
In general, the price of a stock option is influenced by five factors:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item The spot stock price, $S_t$
\item The strike price set in the contract, $K$
\item The remaining time to maturity, $T-t$, where $T$ is the maturity of the option
\item The volatility of the underlying stock price, $\sigma$
\item The risk-free interest rate, $r$
\end{enumerate}

Because a holder of a option contract has the right but not an obligation to exercise the option, the payoff of an option is always non-negative. For a European option, the exercise payoff from a long position is $(S_T - K)^+ = \max \{S_T-K,0\}$. As for an American option, the payoff function is similar; what is different is that we should use the spot stock price $S_t$ when the option is exercised to calculate the payoff, instead of $S_T$ in a European case. 

In many cases there are closed-form pricing formulas for European options. In addition, numerical approaches such as binomial tree and Monte Carlo simulation can solve this problem. We give a brief overview of these numerical methods in Chapter $3$. Because we do not know when an American option will be exercised, the pricing of American options is more complicated. A complete solution to an American option pricing problem should address two aspects, option value and an optimal exercise strategy. However, only in a few cases are analytic solutions available. In most cases, a numerical approach is needed. For example, \cite{Lim2004} proposed an approach to compute both the price and the optimal exercise boundary for American-style lookback options.

In this chapter, we review the two major option pricing principles, no-arbitrage valuation and risk-neutral valuation. The valuation of American options is also discussed. We refer the reader to \cite{2004Broadie} for a more exhaustive review of option valuation models and applications. Since lookback options are a special case of $\alpha$-quantile options with $\alpha = 1$, the pricing methods of lookback options are summarized. 

\section{European options}
\subsection{No-arbitrage valuation}

Absence of arbitrage is the fundamental principle of option pricing. \citet*{Black:1973} is the landmark paper in the field of option pricing. \citet*{merton1973} was the first to extend this valuation model to incorporate dividend payments. In his paper, the rationality of opting pricing was also discussed. 

%\subsubsection{Black-Scholes framework}
The Black-Scholes model is one of the most extensively used models to describe stock price behavior.
Let $S_t$ be the stock price. Then under this model, $S_t$ satisfies 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
dS_t = \mu S_tdt + \sigma S_tdB_t,
\end{equation}
with $\mu$ and $\sigma $ constant, which represent the expected return on the stock and the volatility respectively. The process $\{B_t\}$ is a standard Brownian motion on probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}, \mathbb{Q})$ which represents the underlying uncertainty of the market. With initial stock price $S_0$ at time $0$, the solution to (\ref{eq:1}) is 
\begin{equation}
S_t=S_0\exp((\mu-\sigma^2 /2)t + \sigma B_t)
\end{equation}
Thus stochastic process $S_t$ is also known as that it follows a geometric Brownian motion(GBM). 

There are other assumptions in this model follows:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Investors are able to borrow and lend cash at the same risk-free interest rate $r$. This risk-free interest rate is supposed to be known and is constant. 
\item There are no transaction fees.
\item There are no tax costs. 
\item The stock does not pay a dividend. 
\item Investors can buy any fraction of a share. 
\item Short selling is allowed without limitations and restrictions. 
\item Market is absent of arbitrage opportunity. That is no one can profit from nothing.  
\item Security is trading continuously. This means you can sell or buy security at any time.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions are usually referred to the Black-Scholes framework. Further studies show that many conditions can be relaxed. For simplicity, we follow the Black-Scholes framework in this section.

% This approach to model stock price was first introduced by Black, Scholes and Merton.
% Denote $r$ as the constant continuously compounded risk-free interest rate. Under risk-neutral assumption, we can get $\mu = r $.

%\subsubsection{Black-Scholes PDE}
Let $V(S, t)$ be the price of an option at time $t$ on stock $S$. The value $V(S,T)$ at maturity $T$ is the payoff. To get the value of a option at an earlier time, we should know how its price changes as a function of stock price $S$ and time $t$. Suppose $V(S,t)$ is twice differentiable, applying It\^o's lemma to $V$ we get
\begin{equation}\label{ito}
dV_t = \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S_t \mu + \frac{1}{2}\frac{{\partial}^2}{\partial S^2} {S_t^2} {\sigma}^2 \right) dt + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S_t \sigma d B_t.
\end{equation}

As $V_t$ and $S_t$ share the same underlying, the source of uncertainty is the same for both. Thus we can eliminate Brownian motion $B_t$ by constructing a certain portfolio with stocks and options. The appropriate trading strategy is holding one option and $-{\partial V}/{\partial S}$ shares of stock.

At time $t$, the value of this portfolio is
\begin{equation}
\Pi_t = V_t - \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S_t.
\end{equation}

The instantaneous profit or loss $dR$ over time interval $[t, t+dt]$ is
\begin{equation}\label{dR}
d\Pi_t = dV_t - \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} dS_t.
\end{equation}

Substituting equation (\ref{eq:1}) and (\ref{ito}) in (\ref{dR}), we get
\begin{equation}\label{dR2}
d\Pi_t= \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{{\partial}^2 V }{\partial S^2} S_t^2 {\sigma}^2 \right) dt.
\end{equation}

Equation (\ref{dR2}) does not contain $dB_t$, which means that the return of the portfolio is entirely riskless. Since we suppose the market is absent of arbitrage, the rate of return on this portfolio must be the same as risk-free rate. If the return rate of the portfolio $\Pi$ is larger than the risk-free rate, a investor can borrow at risk-free rate to long the portfolio. By this strategy, the investor can instantly make a profit from nothing. If the return rate of portfolio is smaller than risk-free rate, a investor can short the portfolio and invest the money in risk-free rate. Then again the investor can make a profit from nothing. To reduce the opportunity of arbitrage, the return rate of the riskless portfolio must be equal to the risk-free rate $r$. Then over time period $[t, t + dt]$ we have
\begin{equation}\label{dR3}
r \Pi dt = d\Pi_t =  \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{{\partial}^2}{\partial S^2} S_t^2 {\sigma}^2 \right) dt.
\end{equation}

From (\ref{dR3}), we then get the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE):
\begin{equation}\label{black-pde}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial V }{\partial S} S r + \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\partial}^2 V}{\partial S^2} S^2 {\sigma}^2 -rV=0.
\end{equation}


Let $f(S)$ be the payoff function of an option, then the boundary conditions for this option is

%\begin{numcases}{}
%\begin{equation}
 
%\end{equation}\\
%\begin{equation}
% & \text{on}  [0,T),
%\end{equation}
%\label{final-b}$ & on $[0,T)$. 
%\end{numcases}

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:EuF}
\begin{numcases}{}
V(S_T,T)=f(S_T) & when  $S_T\in \bR^+$, \label{eq:EuFa}\\
V(0,t) =f(0)e^{-r(T-t)} & on $t\in [0,T)$, \label{eq:EuFb}\\
\lim_{S \to \infty} V(S,t)= f(\infty)e^{-r(T-t)} & on $t\in [0,T)$. \label{eq:EuFc}
\end{numcases}
\end{subequations}

(\ref{eq:EuFa}) is the final condition, it is obvious that option price at maturity $V(S_T,T)$ should equal the payoff $F(S_T)$.  PDE (\ref{black-pde}) is a backward parabolic. To get the solution to (\ref{black-pde}), we need boundary conditions at $S_t = 0, t \in [0,T]$ and $S_t=\infty, t \in [0,T]$ additionally. For a call, if $S_t = 0, t \in [0,T]$, then this contract is deep out of money and has no value all the time. Condition (\ref{eq:EuFb}) coincides with this situation. If $S_t$ is big enough that it is deep in the money in the life of an option, the holder will certainly exercise this contact at maturity. Thus this contract is similar to a forward contract and should has the same price $f(\infty)e^{-r(T-t)}$ with a identical forward contract. This is expressed in condition (\ref{eq:EuFc}). One can find that boundary conditions (\ref{eq:EuFb}) and (\ref{eq:EuFc}) also work for put options. %The second equation in (\ref{Black-boundary}) means that if stock price $S_t$ is $0$ all the time in its life, then the price of the option at any time should be the discounted pay off at risk-free rate. The last equation in (\ref{Black-boundary}) is obtained under the same logic. 

PDE (\ref{black-pde}) is the fundamental valuation equation for the standard normal option. There are many transformations that can convert the Black-Scholes PDE into a heat or diffusion equation. In this thesis, we present the transformation suggested in \cite{2004Broadie}. 

Under transformation
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
 S=Ke^x \\
\displaystyle t=T-2\iota/\sigma^2 \\
\displaystyle V(S,t)=e^{-a_1 x - b_1 \iota } v(x, \iota)\\
\displaystyle a_1=(r- \sigma ^2 / 2) / \sigma ^2 \\
\displaystyle b_1= a_1^2 + 2r/{\sigma}^2, 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

$v(x,\iota)$ satisfies the heat equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial \iota} = \frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial x^2},
\end{equation}

with the boundary conditions 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle e^{-a_1 x} v (x,0) = f(K e^x) & \text{on } \bR \\
\displaystyle \lim_{x \to -\infty}e^{-a_1 x- b_1 \iota } v(x,\iota) = f(0)e^{-2r\iota / \sigma ^2} &\text{on } \iota \in [0,\sigma ^2 T /2] \\
\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-a_1 x -b_1 \iota } v(x,\iota) = f(\infty) e^{-2r\iota / \sigma ^2} & \text{on } \iota \in [0, \sigma ^2 T /2].
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The heat equation was originally used to describe the distribution of heat in a continuous medium as time passes. It is a well known subject in Physics and has been thoroughly studied. If $\lim_{x\to \pm \infty} v(x, \tau)= 0$, the normal density function $v(x,t) = (2 \sqrt{\pi t} )^{-1} \exp(-x^2 /{4t})$ with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{2t}$ is the fundamental solution.

%\subsubsection{Black-Scholes formula}
For the European call option, the payoff is $f(S)=(S-K)^+$. Then the valuation formula obtained form the Black-Scholes PDE is
\begin{equation}\label{blfc}
c(S,t;K)=S_t \Phi(d(S_t;K,T-t))-Ke^{-r(T-t)} \Phi(d(S_t;K,T-t)-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}),
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and
\begin{equation}
d(S_t;K,T-t)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}} [\log(\frac{S_t}{K}) + (r+\frac{1}{2}\sigma ^2)(T-t)].
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{blfc}) is known as the Black-Scholes formula for a European call option with strike $K$ and maturity date $T$.

Similarly, the pricing formula for a European put option is
\begin{equation}\label{blfp}
p(S, t;K)= Ke^{-r(T-t)} \Phi(-d(S_t ; K,T-t) +\sigma \sqrt{T-t})-S_t \Phi(-d(S_t;K,T-t)).
\end{equation}

Comparing the pricing formulas for put and call options, we find that equation (\ref{blfc}) and equation (\ref{blfp}) satisfy the relation:
\begin{equation}
c(S,t;K) + K e^{-r(T-t)} = p(S,t;K) + S_t.
\end{equation}

The above relationship between the values of European put and call options is called the put-call parity. We can get the put-call parity by constructing two portfolios. One contains a European call option and $Ke^{-rT}$ in bond which yields risk-free rate. Another contains a European put option and one share of the underlying stock. At maturity of the options, both portfolios are worth 
\begin{equation}
\max(S_T,K).
\end{equation}
Since the European options cannot be exercised before maturity, the two portfolios must have the same value at the beginning. This is the reason why put-call parity holds. Thanks to the put-call parity, if we know the price of a European call option, we can deduce the price of the corresponding European put option with the same strike price and maturity date, and vice versa.


Further studies suggest that some conditions in the Black-Scholes model can be relaxed. Models with transaction fees, short sale constrains and other extensions are available.

%% If we define $G = \ln S$, after some calculation, we get
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
%dG_t = \frac{\mu - \sigma ^2 }{2} dt + \sigma dB_t.
%\end{equation}
%%From this we can see that the natural logarithm of stock price is Brownian motion with drift $\mu$, and variance $\sigma^2$. This model implies that the stock's price at a given time $T$ follows lognormal distribution. The standard deviation of the logarithm of the stock price is $\sigma \sqrt{T}$.
%%
%%Black et. al. \cite{Black:1973} pointed out that the proper price of an option should be the expected present value of its payoff. Based on this idea, there are many studies about the pricing of options. For European plain vanilla option, its price can be priced in closed form. As for American plain vanilla option, because it can be exercised at any time before maturity, the pricing is much more complicated. In this case, it is an optimal stopping problem. Comparing to vanilla option, there are another school of options called exotic options. Exotic options are nonstandard options created by financial engineers, which usually only traded in over-the-counter market.
%%%In this case, one can deduce that the optimal stopping time is given by some region. Precisely, the holder excises the option when stock price enter some region.



\subsection{Risk-neutral valuation}\label{risk-neutral frame}
As revealed in the Black-Scholes PDE (\ref{black-pde}) and the corresponding boundary conditions (\ref{eq:EuF}), the market parameters that are relevant to the price of options include interest rate $r$, volatility $\sigma$, strike price $K$, stock price $S_0$ and time to maturity $T-t$. The expected stock return rate $\mu$, very surprisingly, does not have any influence on the option price. The Black-Scholes PDE also does not involve any parameter regarding the risk preference of investors. This phenomenon brings a hint to another approach of option valuation, risk-neutral valuation. 

Risk-neutral valuation, first introduced by \citet*{cox-ross1976}, is a very important pricing tool. As a powerful and frequently used pricing theory, the mathematical fundamentals of risk-neutral valuation model are very advanced and complicated. But the underlying principle can be easily expressed in the binomial case. 

Assume a risky asset whose price is currently $S$ and its price in the next period is either $Su$ with probability $q$ or $Sd$ with probability $1-q$. Factors $u$ and $d$ indicate one plus the percentage change in asset price. In real world we require extra reward for taking risk. In a risk-averse world, any risky asset is priced as the discounted value of its future expectation. In our example, the expected future price of this asset is $qSu+(1-q)Sd$. Therefore, the current price of this asset should be 
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{qSu+(1-q)Sd}{1+k}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the risky discount factor, sometimes known as the required return rate, which usually consists of risk-free rate $r$ plus a risk premium. Resorting to the famous capital asset pricing model (CAPM), we can deduce the risky discount factor. Thus we can get the price of the asset. 

However, with the knowledge of $S$, $u$ and $d$, can we get the price of the asset in a different order? That is, can we find a new probability pair $p$ and $1-p$ that can substitute $q$ and $1-q$ in the calculation of asset price which allows us to use the risk-free interest rate $r$ instead of risky discount factor $k$? If $d < 1+r < u$, that is, in arbitrage-free world, the answer is affirmative. 

When $d<1+r<u$, if $p$ satisfies $pu+(1-p)d=1+r$, or equivalently $p=(1+r-d)/(u-d)$, we can write the stock price in following manner: 
\begin{equation}\label{r-n-s}
S=\frac{pSu+(1-p)Sd}{1+r}.
\end{equation}

This can be easily proven. Just divide both sides of the above equation (\ref{r-n-s}) by $S$ and multiply with $1+r$, we get $1+r = pu +(1-p)d$, or its equivalent statement $p=(1+r-d)/(u-d)$. This expression shows that we can restate the price of stock by firstly adjusting the probability measure in real world and then discounting the expectation of asset value obtained under the adjusted probability measure at the risk-free rate. The only information we need to know in this process is the volatility and risk-free rate. We need make no assumption about investors' attitude towards risk. This method works on risk-averse, risk-neutral and risk-seeking investors, regardless their risk preference. A world where all individuals are indifferent to risk is called a {\it risk-neutral world}. In this world investors do not demand compensation for taking risk and the expected return for any financial product in a risk-neutral world is the risk-free rate.

We have described above the basic idea of an important derivative pricing principle called the {\it risk-neutral valuation}. The probability $p$ used to calculate expectation in a risk-neutral world is known as the {\it risk-neutral probability measure} or {\it equivalent martingale probability}. With the help of more advanced mathematics, the risk-neutral valuation method remains valid and powerful to deal with the pricing problems for continuous time model. 

In risk-neutral method for continuous time model, the option price $S_t$ follows 
\begin{equation}
dS_t = rS_tdt + \sigma S_t dB_t^{*},
\end{equation}
where $B_t^{*}$ is a standard Brownian motion under the equivalent martingale measure $\mathbb P$. The relation between the equivalent martingale measure $\mathbb P$ and statistical measure $\mathbb Q$ is 
\begin{equation}
d\mathbb P = \exp{\left(-\left(\frac{(\mu-r)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)-\frac{\mu-r}{\sigma}B_t \right) }d\mathbb Q.
\end{equation}

Thus $S(t)$ follows GBM 
\begin{equation}
S_t=S_0\exp((r-\sigma^2 /2)t + \sigma B_t^*)
\end{equation}

Under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb P$, the price of a European option can be stated as 
\begin{equation}
V(S_t,t)=e^{-r(T-t)}\mathbb E[f(S_T)|\mathcal{F}_t], \quad 0\leq t\leq T
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal {F}_t$ is the filtration which contains all the information up to time $t$. Readers can refer to \cite{steven} for the detailed information. 
%Interesting study about this model can be found in \cite{HarrisonKreps1979}, \cite{Harrison1981} and \cite{Kreps1981}.

\section{American options}
In the risk-neutral valuation model, the pricing problem of American options can be defined as a solution to an optimal stopping time problem. 

At time $t$, under the risk-neutral probability measure $\mathbb P$, the price of an American option can be given by
\begin{equation}\label{Am-rn-equation}
V(S,t) =\sup_{t\leq \tau\leq  T}\mathbb E[e^{-r(\tau-t)}f(S_\tau)|\mathcal{F}_t], \quad 0\leq t\leq T
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ denotes a stopping time taking values in $[t,T]$, ${\mathcal{F}_t}$ is the filtration containing all the information up to time $t$ and 
\[
f(S,t) = 
\begin{cases}
(S_t-K)^+ & \text{for call options},\\
(K-S_t)^+ & \text{for put options},
\end{cases}
\]
is the usual payoff function.
%This is an optimal stopping problem. 

We can understand (\ref{Am-rn-equation}) by noticing that $\tau$ corresponds to possible strategies to exercise the option. More precisely, the holder will exercise the option at time $\tau$. The American option price corresponds using the optimal strategy. It can be shown that the optimal exercise strategy is represented by some {\it exercise region} $\mathcal D$ in $(S,t)$-plane, i.e. the optimal stopping time is given by $\tau^*=\min\Set{\xi \in[t,T]|(S_\xi,\xi)\in \mathcal D}\wedge T$. In domain $D$ it is optimal for the holder to exercise the contract. The complement of $D$ is called the {\it continuation region}. 

%There is a systematic way to translate optimal stopping problem (\ref{Am-rn-equation}) into a PDE. However it is also possible to derive the PDE directly, the same way we derived the Black-Scholes PDE (\ref{black-pde}).

We also can price an American option under the Black-Scholes frame work. Suppose we hold the same riskless portfolio 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_t = V_t - \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S_t.
\end{equation} 
The instantaneous return is still 
\begin{equation}
d\Pi_t= \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{{\partial}^2 V }{\partial S^2} S_t^2 {\sigma}^2 \right) dt.
\end{equation}

However, due to the early-exercise feature is only available to a option's holder, the long and short relationship in an American option is asymmetrical. Then the holder of an American option can not earn more than the risk-free rate $r$. Thus for an American option, we get an inequality 
\begin{equation}\label{black-in}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial V }{\partial S} S r + \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\partial}^2 V}{\partial S^2} S^2 {\sigma}^2 -rV \leq 0.
\end{equation}

Since the holder has the early-exercise right, the price of an American option $V(S,t)$ should never be less than the immediate payoff $f(S,t)$. Otherwise there will exist an arbitrage opportunity. Because one can borrow money to buy this contract at the price $V(S,t)$ and immediate exercise it to get a payoff $f(S,t)$. If $V(S,t)<f(S,t)$, this strategy ensures a profit at nothing. To prevent arbitrage, we must have
\begin{equation}\label{Am-a}
V(S,t)\geq f(S,t),  \quad t\in [0,T].
\end{equation}

At maturity we have final condition
\begin{equation}\label{Am-b}
V(S,T)=f(S,T).
\end{equation} 

In \cite{Paul2006}, it is stated that an American option value is maximized if the holder exercises such that 
\begin{equation}\label{Am-c}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \quad  \text{is continuous}. 
\end{equation}

The pricing of an American option in the Black-Scholes frame contains (\ref{black-in}), (\ref{Am-a}), (\ref{Am-b}) and (\ref{Am-c}).


%Let $V(S,t)$ be the price of an American option. Let us consider an American call option. Before the option has been exercised, $V(S,t)$ should satisfy the usual Black-Scholes PDE (\ref{black-pde}). When the stock price is sufficiently high, the holder should exercise the option, otherwise there will be an arbitrage opportunity. We get a free boundary problem:
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{cases}
%\displaystyle\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial V }{\partial S} S r + \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\partial}^2 V}{\partial S^2} {S^2} {\sigma}^2 -rV=0\\
%V(S, T) = f(S,T)\\
%\displaystyle\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}(S,t) = +1 \text{ at the boundary}. 
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}

%In fact ${\partial V(S,t)}/{\partial S}= +1$ is a smoothness condition, since we have $({\partial}/{\partial S})(S-K)^+ = 1$ when $S>K$.  

\section{Lookback options}
Lookback options are a type of exotic options whose payoffs are path-dependent. A lookback option gives the holder the right to look back in time to use the maximum or minimum asset price achieved up to the time the option was exercised to calculate the option's payoff. Depending on the selection of the strike price, you can find two styles of lookback options: floating-strike lookback options and fixed-strike lookback options.

\subsection{Floating-strike lookback option}
As you can see from the name, the strike price of this kind of lookback option is floating and is determined until the end of the option's life, i.e., at maturity if early exercise is not allowed. Denote $S_{\min}^t$ and $S_{\max}^t$ as the minimum and maximum underlying asset price achieved over $[0,t]$. Then for a European-style lookback call option with floating strike, the payoff is the amount that the final asset price $S_T$ exceeds the minimum asset price $S_{\min}^{T}$ attained during the life of the option. The payoff function for floating-strike lookbcak call option is 
\begin{equation}
LC_{floating} = S_T - S_{\min}^T.
\end{equation}

As for the put option of this type, the payoff is the amount by which the maximum asset price $S_{\max}$ attained during the life of the option exceeds the final asset price $S_T$. Hence the payoff function for the floating-strike lookback put option is given as
\begin{equation}
LP_{floating}=S_{\max}^T-S_T.
\end{equation} 

A floating-strike lookback call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the lowest price achieved during the life of the option, while a floating strike lookback put option provides the holder one way to sell the underlying asset at the highest price during the life of an option. 

One interesting fact about the floating-strike lookback options are that these options are never out of the money. Therefore a holder of a European-style option of this type will always exercise the option at maturity. This fact, that it is always in the money, makes a floating-strike lookback option more expensive than the corresponding plain vanilla option. 

\cite{Goldman1979} provided valuation formulas for European-style floating strike lookback options using risk-neutral pricing method. Comparing to payoff functions of most of the options which are only the positive part of the difference between two variables, the payoff function of this type of lookback options is simply the difference between two variables. Because of the additivity of conditional expectation, the pricing problem of this type of European-style options can be easily solved by risk-neutral method. Reader can refer to \cite{Bingham1998} for the proof. Using the similar notation of \cite{Hull2008}, the value of a call option of this type is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
\begin{split}
\displaystyle V(S,t;{S_{\min}}) &= S_t\Phi(a_1) - \frac{\sigma ^2}{2r}S_t\Phi(-a_1) \\
& - S_{\min}^t e^{-r(T-t)}\left(\Phi(a_2) - \frac{\sigma^2}{2r} e ^{Y_1}  \Phi(-a_3)\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\[\displaystyle
\begin{split}
\displaystyle a_1 &=\frac{\ln(S_t / S_{\min}^t) + (r+\sigma^2 /2)(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{(T-t)}}\\
a_2 &= a_1 - \sigma \sqrt{(T-t)}\\
a_3 &= \frac{\ln(S_t / S_{\min}^t)+ (-r+\sigma^2 / 2)(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{(T-t)}}\\
Y_1 &= - \frac{2(r-\sigma^2 / 2) \ln(S_t / S_{\min}^t)}{\sigma^2}.
\end{split}
\]

The value of a put option of this type is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
\begin{split}
V(S,t;S_{\max{}}) &= S_t \frac{\sigma^2}{2r} \Phi(-b_2) - S_t \Phi(b_2)\\
&+ S_{\max{}}^t e^{-r(T-t)} \left(\Phi(b_1) - \frac{\sigma^2}{2r} e^{Y_2} \Phi(-b_3)\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\[
\begin{split}
\displaystyle b_1 &= \frac{\ln(S_{\max}^t / S_t) + (-r+\sigma^2 /2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{(T-t)}}\\
b_2 &= b_1 - \sigma\sqrt{(T-t)}\\
b_3 &= \frac{\ln(S_{\max}^t / S_t) + (r-\sigma^2 /2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{(T-t)}}\\
\displaystyle Y_2 &= \frac{2(r-\sigma^2 / 2) \ln(S_{\max}^t / S_t)}{\sigma^2}.
\end{split}
\]

We should notice that at the initiation of the contract, i.e., at time $0$, $S_{\max}^0=S_{\min}^0=S_0$.
Formulas (\ref{eq:3}) and (\ref{eq:5}) are obtained under the assumption that the underlying asset price is observed continuously. However, in real life, the asset price is observed discretely. \cite{Broadie1999} provided a correction to these formulas to deal with discrete situation.

For the discretely monitored options, let $m$ be the number of price-fixing dates and $\Delta t= T/m$ be the interval between fixings. In this section we denote $\tS_{\min{}}^t$ as the discretely monitored realized minimum over $[0,t]$, $\tS_{\max{}}^t$ as the discretely monitored realized maximum over $[0,t]$. In addition, denote $V_d(S,t;\tS_{\max{}})$ as the price of a discretely monitored European-style lookback put option at time $t$ and $V_d(S,t;\tS_{\min{}}^t)$ as the price of a discretely monitored call option of this style. In \cite{Broadie1999}, the price of a discretely monitored lookback option put option at the $k$-th fixing date and the price of a corresponding continuously monitored lookback put option at time $t = k\Delta t$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
V_d(S,t;\tS_{\max{}})
=[e^{-\beta_1 \sigma \sqrt{{T/m}}}
V(S,t;\tS_{\max{}} e^{\beta _1 \sigma \sqrt{T/m}}) +
(e^{-\beta_1 \sigma \sqrt{{T/m}}} -1)S_t ]+ o(1/\sqrt{m}),
\end{equation}
where function $V(\cdot)$ in the right hand side is the valuation formula (\ref{eq:5}) for continuously monitored lookback put option, and 
\[
\begin{split}
\displaystyle
\beta_1 &= \lim_{m\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{m}E[\max_{0\leq t \leq T} B_t - \max_{0\leq k \leq m} B_{kT/m}]}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}\\
& \approx 0.5826.
\end{split}
\]

As for the discretely monitored lookback call option, \cite{Broadie1999} showed its price can be expressed in relation with the price of a corresponding continuously monitored lookback call option in following manner: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
V_d(S,t;\tS_{\min{}})
=-[e^{\beta_1 \sigma \sqrt{{T/m}}}
V(S,t;\tS_{\min{}} e^{-\beta _1 \sigma \sqrt{T/m}}) +
(e^{\beta_1 \sigma \sqrt{{T/m}}} -1)S_t ]+ o(1/\sqrt{m}),
\end{equation}
where function $V(\cdot)$ in the right hand side is the valuation formula (\ref{eq:3}) for continuously monitored lookback put option. 

By this correction, we can use pricing formulas for continuously monitored lookback options to value discretely monitored ones. We know that at time $t$, the value for the discretely monitored running maximum $\tS_{\max{}}$ is known and available. To get the value for a discretely monitored lookback put option, first we should inflate the discretely monitored running maximum $\tS_{\max{}}$ by a factor of $e^{\beta_1 \sigma \sqrt{T/m}}$; second using this value as the strike price when use formula (\ref{eq:5}) to get a price; then deflate this price by the same factor; finally add $(e^{-\beta_1 \sigma \sqrt{{T/m}}} -1)S_t$ to the deflated price and this value is the price for the discretely monitored lookback put option. For a discretely monitored lookback call option, we can get its price by applying the similar procedure as indicated in (\ref{eq:8}).

\subsection{Fixed strike lookback option}
Similar to plain vanilla options, a lookback option's strike price also can be fixed. The difference, compared with the standard European option, is that a fixed strike lookback option is not exercised at the underlying asset price at maturity. Instead, the payoff is the difference between the extreme underlying asset price and the strike price, if the difference is positive, and zero otherwise. 
   
For a fixed-strike lookback call option, the holder is allowed to calculate the payoff using the highest underlying asset price attained before maturity. As for a fixed lookback put option, the holder can use the underlying asset's lowest price. One finds that the intrinsic value of a fixed-strike strike lookback option is nondecreasing as time passes. The payoff functions for fixed-strike lookback call and put options respectively are:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&LC_{fixed} = \max\{S_{\max} - K, 0\}, \\
&LP_{fixed} = \max\{K-S_{\min},0\},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the strike price.

The pricing formulas of fixed-strike lookback options are given by \cite{Conze1991}. Reader also can find these formulas 
in \cite{Paul2006}.
Denote 
\[
\begin{split}\displaystyle
d &= (\ln(S_t / K) + ( r+ \sigma^2 /2)(T-t))/ ({\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}), \\
d' &=(\ln (S_t / S_{\max}^t) + (r + \sigma^2 /2)(T-t))/ ({\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}), \\
\displaystyle d'' &=(\ln(S_t / S_{\min}^t) + (r + \sigma^2 /2)(T-t))/ ({\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}).
\end{split}
\]
 
Under the risk-neutral pricing frame work of section \ref{risk-neutral frame}, the value of a call option of this type at time $t$ is 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\displaystyle
&V(S_{\max},t;K) \\
= &\, S_t \Phi(d) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d-\sigma \sqrt{T-t}) \\
&+ S_t e^{-r(T-t)} \frac{\sigma^2}{2r} \left[ -\left(\frac{S_t}{K}\right)^{-{2r/\sigma^2}} \Phi\left(d-\frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T-t}\right) + e^{r(T-t)}\Phi(d)\right], \quad K\geq S_{\max}^t ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&V(S_{\max},t;K)\\ 
= &\, e^{-r(T-t)}(S_{\max}^t - K) + S_t \Phi(d') - S_{\min}^t e^{-r(T-t)} \Phi(d'-\sigma \sqrt{T-t}) \\
&+ S_t e^{-r(T-t)} \frac{\sigma ^2}{2r}\left[ -\left(\frac{S_t}{S_{\max}^t}\right)^{-{2r/\sigma^2}}\Phi\left(d'-\frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T-t}\right) + e^{r(T-t)}\Phi(d')\right], \quad K<S_{\max}^t .
\end{split}
\end{equation}


Similarly, the value of the put is 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& V(S_{\min},t;K)\\
=&\, -S_t \Phi(-d) + Ke^{-r(T-t)} \Phi(-d + \sigma \sqrt{T-t})  \\
&+ S_t e^{-r(T-t)} \frac{\sigma^2}{2r}\left[ \left(\frac{S_t}{K}\right)^{-2r /\sigma^2}\Phi\left(-d+\frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T-t}\right) - e^{r(T-t)}\Phi(-d)\right], \quad K\leq S_{\min}^t,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& V(S_{\min},t;K) \\
=&\, e^{-r(T-t)} (K-S_{\min}^t) - S_t \Phi(-d'') + S_{\min}^t e^{-r(T-t)} N (-d'' + \sigma \sqrt{T-t}) \\
&+ S_t e^{-r(T-t)} \frac{\sigma^2}{2r} \left[\left(\frac{S_t}{S_{\max}^t}\right)^{-2r/\sigma^2}\Phi\left(-d'' + \frac{2r}{\sigma} \sqrt{T-t}\right) -e^{r(T-t)}\Phi(-d'')\right], \quad K > S_{\min}^t.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

 
\subsection{American-style lookback options}

For the American-style lookback option, one should provide both the option price and the optimal exercise strategy to completely solve the pricing problem. Due to this complexity, usually we need numerical approachs to price American-style lookback options. 

\cite{Lim2004} provided two numerical methods to compute the price and the optimal exercise boundary. In their paper, they proposed a space-time transformation which can simplify the pricing of options of this type. Under this transformation, calendar time is scaled by the square of volatility $\sigma^2$. Therefore, the canonical time horizon is much smaller than time to expiration $T-t$.
The first numerical method described in \cite{Lim2004} is a backward induction scheme using bernoulli walks. Moreover, Chernoff-Petkau correction was involved to improve the approximation of the continous-time optimal stopping boundary. 
By finding the decomposition formula for American lookback put option, 
\cite{Lim2004} written done a integral equation for the optimal stopping boundary.
Then they developed the second method by solving that integral equation numerically. 

%Fix a process $X_t$, define $M_t = \max_{0\leq s\leq t} X_s$.
%When $X_t$ is a standard brownian motion without drift,
%the joint distribution of $M_t$ and $X_t$ can be easly calculated by reflection principle\cite{Karatzas91}:
%\[
%P(X_t \in a+dx, M_t \in b+dm) =
%\]

\chapter{Numerical methods}

For American and path-dependent options, generally closed form pricing formulas are not available. In this case, usually numerical methods may be required. Even for the Black-Scholes formula, in practice, integration and the normal probability are obtained numerically. In this chapter, we provide a overview of two commonly used numerical methods for option pricing, namely lattice methods and Monte Carlo simulation. Generally speaking, different numerical methods are applicable in different situations. 

\section{Lattice methods}
Lattice methods, also known as tree methods, use discrete time and discrete state approximations of the evolvements of underlying assets to calculate option prices. The lattice method was originally proposed in \cite{cox1979}. Lattice approaches are popular because they are easy to understand and implement. In the risk-neutral valuation framework for geometric Brownian motion, the underlying asset price follows $S_{t+h} = S_t e^{Z}$, and $Z\sim \Phi((r-\sigma ^2 /2)h,\sigma ^2 h)$. In the lattice method, over a discrete time interval, a discrete random variable $X$ is used to approximate $Z$: $X$ takes value as $x_i$ with probability $p_i$, $i=1,2,...,m$. If $m=2$, we have a binomial tree; If $m=3$, we have a trinomial tree. The value of the parameters of the distribution of the discrete random variable $X$ are chosen to approximate the distribution of continuous random variable $Z$ exactly or consistently. Since the value of an option is the discounted present value of the expectation of the option's payoff, we first use a discrete diagram to approximate the continuous path of the price of underlying asset in the lattice method and then calculate the discrete expectation of the payoff as an approximation of the option price. Due to the simplicity of lattice method, modified lattice methods for models with dividends, barriers and other complicated features can be easily constructed. However, the key issue of lattice method is the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. 

There are plenty of proposals for tree methods. We present the popularly used approximations in Table \ref{well-know-lattic-methods}.
\begin{table}[htdp]\label{well-know-lattic-methods}
\caption{Well known Lattice Methods}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Lattice & Approximation   & Probabilty \\
\hline
\cite{cox1979} & $x_1= \sigma\sqrt{h}$ & $p_1 =\frac{e^{rh}-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}}-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}$ \\
   &  $x_2=-\sigma\sqrt{h}$& $1-p_1$ \\

\cite{jarrow1983} & $x_1 = (r-\sigma^2 /2)h+\sigma\sqrt{h}$ & $p_1 = \frac{e^{\sigma^2 h/2}-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}}-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}$ \\   
& $x_2 =(r-\sigma^2 /2)h - \sigma\sqrt{h}$ & $p_2 = 1- p_1$ \\

& $x_2 = (r-\ln(\cosh(\sigma\sqrt{h})))h-\sigma\sqrt{h}$ & $p_2 = 1/2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{default}
\end{table}%

\section{Monte Carlo simulation}
As we discussed in risk-neutral pricing method, option valuation often end to the calculation of an expected value of a certain discounted payoff. For some cases, we can do this computation explicitly. The Black-Scholes formula is a example of this class. But for most of the time, we need the help of numerical methods. Monte Carlo simulation is a natural proposal to calculate expectation. Monte Carlo method is very useful to price options with multiple underlying assets. This method is first used to evaluate a European option by \cite{Boyle1977}. 

Generally, Monte Carlo method is done in following steps: 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item 
Generate sample paths for the underlying random variables in question according to the risk-neutral measure. 
\item
Calculate the corresponding discounted payoff for each sample path.
\item
Calculate the average discounted payoff on all the samples.
\end{enumerate}

The sharp advantage of Monte Carlo method lies in its convenience in calculation high dimensional integrations. 
The convergence of Monte Carlo is guaranteed by large number theory. Now the focus of the study in this field is on improving the  computational efficiency. Interested readers can find detailed survey on this method in \cite{Boyle1997} and \cite{Glasserman2004}. 



\chapter{$\alpha$-quantile and $\alpha$-quantile option}
For a stochastic process $X_t$,
the $\alpha$-quantile $( 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1)$
is defined by
\[
M(\alpha,t)(\omega) = \inf\Set{x:\int_0^t 1_{(X_s (\omega)\leq x)} > \alpha t}.
\]
Then we can see that $\inf_{0\leq s \leq t}  X_s = lim_{\alpha\to 0}M(\alpha,t)$ and $\sup_{(0\leq s \leq t})  X_s = lim_{\alpha\to 1} M(\alpha, t)$. %In this sense $\alpha$-quantile option can be considered as a general class of lookback option. Unlike lookback option whose payoff depends on the maximum or minimum of the price of stock before maturity as mentioned before, $\alpha$-quantile option's payoff depends on the quantile of the stock price process. This option was first introduced by \cite{Miura} in 1992. \cite{Akahori1995} gave a generalized arc-sine law for this type of options by Feynman-Kac formula.
When $X_{t}$ is a Brownian motion defined as $ X_t = \sigma B_t + \mu t$, using Feynman-Kac formula, \cite{Dassios1995} obtained the explicit density of $\alpha$-quantile and gave an exceptional representation of the distribution of quantile. In \cite{Dassios1995}, for $\alpha\in[0,1]$, $t\leq 0$, Dassios proved that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Dassios}
M(\alpha, t) \eqlaw \sup_{s \leq \alpha t} X_s + \inf_{s\leq (1-\alpha)t} X'_s ,
\end{equation}
where $X'$ is a independent copy of $X$. Later \cite{EmRoge1995} gave two proofs of this theorem without using Feynman-Kac computations.

\section{$\alpha$-quantile}
\subsection{The distribution function of $\alpha$-quantile of Brownian motion}
In 1995, Yor gave the distribution function of the $\alpha$-quantile of Brownian motion without drift in \cite{Yor1995}. He obtained this result by simplifying related integral expressions in \cite{Miura}. When $\mu = 0$, that is Brownian motion $B_t$  without drift, define $\theta = ((1 - \alpha)/(\alpha))^{1/2}$, for the Brownian quantiles on time interval $[0, 1]$,  in \cite{Yor1995} we find:
\begin{equation}
P(M(\alpha,1)\in dx)= \begin{cases}
\sqrt{2 / \pi}exp(-x^2 / 2) \Phi(|x| / \theta)dx  &  \text{if } x \leq 0 \\
\sqrt{2 / \pi}exp(-x^2 / 2) \Phi(\theta x)dx  &  \text{if } x \geq 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:density}
\widetilde{\Phi} (x) = \sqrt{2/ \pi} \int^{\infty}_x dy \exp(-y^2 / 2)  \quad   (x \geq 0).
\end{equation}


When $u \neq 0$,  \cite{Dassios1995} addressed this question for a more general case.  As stated in equation (\ref{eq:Dassios}), the distribution of $M(\alpha , t)$ can be represented in terms of the maximum and minimum of process $\{X_t\}$. Therefore we can get the density function of $M(\alpha, t)$ expressed as the convolution of the other two density functions.

Denote $g(x; \alpha , t)$ as the density function of $M(\alpha , t)$, in \cite{Dassios1995}, we find that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fulldensity}
g(x; \alpha , t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} g_1 (x-y; \alpha t) g_2 (y; (1-\alpha) t)dy ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
g_1 (x;t) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sigma}\left({\frac{2}{\pi t}}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu t)^2}{2\sigma ^2 t}\right\} \\
\displaystyle\quad - \frac{2\mu}{\sigma ^2} \exp\left(\frac{2\mu x}{\sigma ^2}\right)\left[1- \Phi \left(\frac{x+\mu t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}\right)\right], & x > 0 ,\\
0 , & x  \leq 0 ,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
g_2 (x;t) = \begin{cases}
0, & x \geq 0 \\
\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sigma}\left({\frac{2}{\pi t}}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu t)^2}{2\sigma ^2 t}\right\} \\
\displaystyle\quad + \frac{2\mu}{\sigma ^2} \exp\left(\frac{2\mu x}{\sigma ^2}\right) \Phi \left(\frac{x+\mu t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}\right) , & x < 0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and $\Phi(x)=\int^{x}_{-\infty}(2\pi)^{(-1/2)}\exp(-y^2 /2)dy$ is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable. 

\subsection{The joint distribution of a Brownian motion and $\alpha$-quantile}
In this section we are going to provide the joint distribution of a Brownian motion and its quantile. When the Brownian motion is without drift,
i.e. $\mu = 0 $,
as we know the joint density function of running maximum and the end point of
a standard Brownian motion at time $\tau$ is
\[
P(X_\tau\in da, M_\tau\in db) =
\frac{2(2b-a)}{\sqrt{2\pi \tau^3}} \exp\left(-\frac{(2b-a)^2}{2\tau}\right)
I_{\Set{a\leq b, b\geq 0}} (a,b) da db \triangleq p_\tau(a,b)
\]

To deal with the distribution of $\alpha$-quantile, we use two copy of
Brownian motion and denote corresponding value at
$\tau=\alpha t$ (respectively $\tau=(1-\alpha) t$) by $X_1$ (respectively $X_2$) and
the corresponding maximum as $M_1$ (respectively $M_2$).
Then
\[
\begin{split}
(X_1,M_1, X_2, M_2) \sim& P(X_1\in dx_1, M_1\in dm_1, X_2\in dx_2, M_2\in dm_2)\\
&= P_{\alpha t}(x_1, m_1) P_{(1-\alpha)t}(x_2,m_2) dx_1dm_1dx_2dm_2
\end{split}
\]


Use the transform
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
X_1\\ X_2\\ M_1\\ M_2\\
\end{pmatrix}
\overset{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 &0 \\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -1\\
\end{pmatrix}
}{\longrightarrow}
\begin{pmatrix}
X_1+X_2\\
X_1 - X_2 \\
M_1 + M_2 \\
M_1 - M_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\triangleq
\begin{pmatrix}
X \\ \tX\\ \tM \\M
\end{pmatrix}
\]

And
\[
(X, \tX, M, \tM) \sim \frac{1}{4} P_{\alpha t}(\frac{x+\tx}{2},\frac{m+\tm}{2})
P_{(1-\alpha)t}(\frac{x-\tx}{2},\frac{\tm-m}{2}) I_D,
\]
where $D$ is the domain $\Set{x_1\leq m_1, x_2\leq m_2, m_1 >0, m_2>0}$


Hence 
\[
\begin{split}
&P(M_{\alpha,t}\in dm, X_t \in dx) = P(M_1-M_2\in dm, X_1+X_2\in dx) \\
=& \frac{1}{4} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^\infty

\subsection{Euler scheme and random walk}\label{s:euler}
%%Another approach to price quantile option is Monte Carlo simulation. In this method, we need to use the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function of $\alpha$-quantile. When the brownian motion is without drift, 

Sometimes to get the integration of a certain stochastic process, we are only able to get the value numerically. For example, if we need to know $\int^T_{0} M(\alpha , t)dt$, usually we need to simulate a discretized version of the Brownian motion $\{B_t\}$ and then do the calculation based on the simulated sample. Obviously, the accuracy of this approximation is closely related to the length of the discretized time increment, which we denote as $\Delta t= \frac{T}{N}$. Then the questions arise: how fine should the discretization length be in order to get a satisfied approximation and whether we can quantify the accuracy of this type of simulation. 

The most straightforward approach to get a simulation of $M(\alpha , T)$ is to apply the Euler approximation. In this method, we first get a sample of $\{X_{n \Delta t}\}$, $0\leq n \leq N$. Then we arrange the sample in ascending order and find the $k= \lfloor \alpha  N\rfloor$-th number as an discretized approximation of $M(\alpha , T)$. We denote $M(k, N)$ the approximation of $\alpha$-quantile under Euler scheme. The absolute error 
\begin{equation}\label{strong}
E\|M(\alpha, T)-M(k,N)\|_2
\end{equation}
is one popular measure of the quality of estimation and here $\|\;\| _2$ is the Euclidean distance. If (\ref{strong}) is $O(\Delta t^\gamma)$ as $\Delta t \downarrow 0$, this approximation is claimed to {\it converge strongly} with order $\gamma > 0 $. Strong convergency is important when fine path-wise approximation is need. Meanwhile, an approximation {\it converges weakly} with order $\beta > 0$ if, for any function $g: \bR \to \bR$ such that all derivatives up to and including $\lceil 2(\beta + 1) \rceil$ exsit, are continuous and have polynomial growth, 
\begin{equation}
|Eg(M(\alpha,T)) - Eg(M(k, N))| = O (\Delta t^\beta) 
\end{equation}
as $\Delta t \downarrow 0$. Weak approximation is of importance when only an estimation of the probability distribution of $M(\alpha, T)$ is essential. 

We are interested in the discretization error of Euler scheme for $\alpha$-quantile. Here we present a numerical study of the convergency of Euler scheme. 
%Since usually the knowledge of distribution is already enough to solve many questions, we focus on the weak convergency. 
For our one dimensional problem, the strong convergence measure can be restated as 
\begin{equation}
E|M(\alpha, T)-M(k,N)|.
\end{equation}
Because the lack of theoretical study on the discretized quantile, we are not able to give a theoretical conclusion on the strong convergency. Instead, here we present a numerical study of the strong convergency. 

The most challenging part of the design of this experiment is that the samplings of continuous $\alpha$-quantile $M(\alpha, T)$ and the discretized $\alpha$-quantile obtained under Euler scheme $M(k,N)$ should share the same path. The reason is because the discretized error is an expectation. Therefore the traditional method to get samples for continuous random variables, Monte Carlo simulation, is not helpful any more. To address this phenomenon, we use a much finer Euler approximation, in our example $\Delta t = \frac{1}{2^{27}}$, as an approximation of the continuous  $\alpha$-quantile $M(\alpha, T)$. 

The parameter setting is : 
\begin{equation}
 N = 2^b , 2^{b+1} , ... 2^{d} ; X_0 = 0; 
\alpha_j =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{j}{2^b} , j = 0, 1 , 2..., 2^{b-1}
\end{equation}

The algorithm: 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Generate $2^{d}$ normal random sample $\Set{x_i}$ 
  with mean $\tmu=\mu/2^d$ ,
  $\tsigma = \sigma \sqrt {\frac{T}{2^b}}$ ,
  add them up according to time and record them as
  $X_k = \sum_{1\leq i \leq k} x_i$ starting with $X_0$.
\item Calculate the $\alpha_j$ quantiles 
  $M_{j,s}\triangleq M_{\alpha_j 2^s,2^s}$ for sequence 
  $\Set{X_k|k=i 2^{d-s}, 1\leq i\leq 2^{s}}$, where $b\leq s \leq d$. 
\item Use $M_{j,d}$ as the continuous quantiles $M(\alpha_j , T)$.
\item Repeat the above for $L$ times,
  get a sequence of data $\Set{M_{j,s}^{(l)}}_{1\leq l\leq L}$
\item Calculate the mean of errors for $s < d$ using:
\begin{align}
Err^{abs}_{j,s} &= \frac{1}{L}\sum_{1\leq l \leq L} \abs{M_{j,s}^{(l)}- M_{j,d}^{(l)}}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

We realize this algorithm for $d=27$,$b=6$,$\mu=0$, $\sigma^2=1$, $T=1$,$X_0=0$ and generate more than 2000 sampled paths. The results are showed in Figure \ref{f:ab}. We are dealing with $\mu = 0$ currently. By the symmetric effect of a Brownian motion without drift. We only examine $\alpha$-quantiles where $\alpha$ vary from $[50\%,100\%]$. %It is well known that the convergence rate of Euler scheme for Brownian motion is $1$. 

In \cite{Janssen2008}, we find that the strong convergence rate of Euler Scheme for the maximum of a Brownian motion is $1/2$. Then it seems reasonable to guess that the convergence rate for $\alpha$-quantiles of Brownian motion decrease from $1$ to ${1/2}$ as the value of $\alpha$ vary from $100\%$ to $50\%$. However, numerical results shows that the convergence rate for $\alpha$-quantile do not work that way. Figure \ref{f:ab} shows that there exists a big difference between the convergence patterns for the maximum of a Brownian motion and other $\alpha$-quantiles of a Brownian motion. On the other hand, the convergence patterns for different $\alpha$-quantiles are quite similar when $\alpha$ varies from $[50\%, 100\%)$. 

In Figure \ref{f:ab}, the horizontal index $s$ means that the result is obtained on a path in which we divide the whole path on time interval $[0,T]$ into $2^{s}$ equal small intervals. Then to examine the convergence patterns for the increase of denseness on a apple to apple case, we should take logarithm of the errors. The similarity of the convergence patterns of $\alpha$-quantiles when $\alpha$ is between $[50\%, 100\%)$ is more obvious after we take the logarithm. 

In Figure \ref{f:lab}, you can see that except for the maximum, i.e. the $100\%$-quantile, the convergence rates of other $\alpha$-quantiles of Brownian motion are close to each other. This is reflected as the lines parallel to each other. Figure \ref{f:ratio} is the convergence rate for different $\alpha$-quantiles. You can see that the convergence rate for $100\%$-quantile is close to ${1/2}$, while convergence rates for other quantile are centered on $0.75$.

\subsection{An estimate of week discretization error}
\label{sec:de}

Let $X_k$ be a random walk (assume $X_0=0$)
with i.i.d increment, i.e.
$\Delta X_k = X_k -  X_{k-1}$ is i.i.d.
Define the ordered statistics $M_{k,n}$ be the $k$-th smallest value in
$\Set{X_i}_{i=0}^n$.
Under this setting, clearly, $M_{0,n} = \inf_{0\leq i\leq n}X_i$
and $M_{n,n} = \sup_{0\leq i\leq n}X_i$
Define
\[X'_i = X_{i+k}-X_k\]
for fixed $k, n$.

In \cite{Wendel1960}, an identity about random walk with
i.i.d increment was derived:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dpathdec}
(M_{k,n}, X_n) \eqlaw (\sup_{i\leq k} X_i +\inf_{i\leq n-k} X'_i, X_n).
\end{equation}

%In \cite{Chaumont1999}, the author provided a combinatory treatment.
%He constructed a explicit path transform for $S$ to $\tS$, such that
%\[
%(M_{k,n}, S_n) = (\sup_{i\leq k} \tS_i+\inf_{i\leq n-k} \tS'_i, \tS_n)
%\]
%Here $\tS$ has same distribution with $S$ and each path $S$
% one-one correspondence to $\tS$.

By using path transform, in \cite{Chaumont1999}, they proved
following continuous version of path decomposition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpathdec}
(M_{\alpha,T}, X_T) \eqlaw (\sup_{t\leq \alpha{T}} X_t +\inf_{t \leq (1-\alpha)T} X'_t, X_T),
\end{equation}
where
\[
X'_t = X_{\alpha T+t} - X_{\alpha_T}.
\]

For the Brownian motion case, this formula were proved in many different ways
and original due to \cite{Dassios1995}.


\cite{Janssen2008} provided an estimate of the difference of expectations
between the maximum of a Brownian motion and that associated with Ganssian random walks.
Since we just give a really rough estimate, we only list the first two terms.
For $W_t$ a Brownian motion with drift $\mu$ and variance $1$ on time interval $[0,1]$, that is $W_t = \mu t + B_t$, where $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, we can get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:est1}
E\max_{0\leq t \leq 1} W(t) - E\max_{n=0,\cdots, N}W(n/N)
= -\frac{\zeta(1/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi N}}-\frac{2g(1)-\mu}{4N} + O(1/N^{3/2}),
\end{equation}
where
\[
g(t) = \mu \Phi(\mu \sqrt{t}) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi t}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mu^2 t}.
\]
\[
\zeta(1/2) \approx -3.92264613.
\]
\def\tW{\widetilde{W}}

For general Brownian $\tW(t)$ motion on time interval $[0,T]$ with drift $\tmu$, variance $\tsigma$,
we use following transform
\begin{align*}
\tW_t &= \tsigma \sqrt{T}W_{t/T} = \tsigma \sqrt{T} \mu t/T
+ \sqrt{T}\tsigma B_{t/T}\\
\mu &= \tmu \sqrt{T}/\tsigma
\end{align*}

\def\tg{\widetilde{g}}
We denote
\begin{equation}
\tg(\mu)=\mu \Phi(\mu) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-{1/2}\mu^2 }
\end{equation}

We derive the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:maxest}
\begin{split}
&E\max_{0\leq t\leq T} \tW(t) - E \max_{0\leq n \leq N} \tW(nT/N)\\ 
= & -\frac{\zeta(1/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\tsigma \sqrt{T/N}
 -\frac{2\tg(\mu)-\tmu\sqrt{T} / \tsigma}{4N}\tsigma\sqrt{T} +
O(\sqrt{T}/N^{3/2})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Now combine $(\ref{eq:cpathdec})$ $(\ref{eq:dpathdec})$ and $(\ref{eq:maxest})$, for $0 < \alpha < 1$,
we get an very rough estimate of the approximation order:
\allowdisplaybreaks
\begin{align*}
\E (M_{\alpha,T}) - \E (M_{k,N})
=& \EE{\sup_{t\leq \alpha{T}} X_t +\inf_{t \leq (1-\alpha)T}X'_t}
- \EE{\sup_{i\leq k} X_i+\inf_{i\leq N-k} X'_i}\\
=& \EE{\sup_{t\leq \alpha{T}} X_t +\inf_{t \leq (1-\alpha)T}X'_t
-  \sup_{i\leq k} X_i-\inf_{i\leq N-k} X'_i} \\
= &  \EE{\sup_{t\leq \alpha{T}} X_t - \sup_{i\leq k} X_i} +
\EE{\inf_{t \leq (1-\alpha)T} X'_t-\inf_{i\leq N-k} X'_i}\\
=& -\frac{\zeta(1/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\tsigma \sqrt{\frac{\alpha T}{\alpha N}} - \frac{2\tg(\mu_1)-\mu_1}{4N}\tsigma\sqrt{\alpha T} +O(1/N^\frac{3}{2}) \\
&-\left(\frac{\zeta(1/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\tsigma \sqrt{\frac{(1-\alpha)T}{(1-\alpha)N}} - \frac{2\tg(\mu_2) - \mu_2}{4N}\tsigma \sqrt{(1-\alpha)T} + O(1/N^\frac{3}{2})\right) \\
=& -\frac{\zeta(1/2) \tsigma}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(\sqrt{T/\alpha N}
\sqrt{\alpha} - \sqrt{T/(1-\alpha)N}\sqrt{1-\alpha}\right) \\
& - \frac{\tsigma\sqrt{T}}{4N}\left((2\tg(\mu_1)-\mu_1)\sqrt\alpha - (2\tg(\mu_2)-\mu_2)\sqrt{(1-\alpha)}\right) \\
&+ O(1/N^\frac{3}{2}) \\
=&- \frac{\tsigma\sqrt{T}}{4N}\left((2\tg(\mu_1)-\mu_1)\sqrt\alpha - (2\tg(\mu_2)-\mu_2)\sqrt{(1-\alpha)}\right) \\
& + O(1/N^{\frac{3}{2}}),
\end{align*}
where $k = \alpha N$, $\mu_1 =\tmu\sqrt{\alpha T}/\tsigma$, and $\mu_2 =\tmu\sqrt{(1-\alpha)T}/\tsigma$.
The third last equality holds by view $\inf_{t\leq (1-\alpha)T} S'_t$ as
$-\max_{t\leq (1-\alpha)T} (-S'_t)$.

This proof shows that the convergence order are all $1$ when $0<\alpha < 1$. When $\alpha = 0$ or $\alpha = 1$, the convergence rate is ${1/2}$. This partially explains the phenomenon related with the strong convergence rate we discussed in section \ref{s:euler}.   %If $\alpha=1/2$ and the Brownian motion does not have  drift ($\mu=0$), it is easy to see (by noting that $\E M_{1/2,T} = \E -M_{1/2,T}$) $\E M_{1/2,T} = \E M_{k,N} = 0$.When the Brownian motion has drift, the order becomes $1$.

Using the same algorithm in section \ref{s:euler},
we have done a simulation to examine the above claim. 
Here we first restate the parameter setting and algorithm.

The parameter setting is : 
\begin{equation}
N = 2^b , 2^{b+1} , ... 2^{d} ;
\alpha_j =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{j}{2^b} , j = 0, 1 , 2..., 2^{b-1}
\end{equation}

The algorithm: 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Generate $2^{d}$ normal random sample $\Set{x_i}$ 
  with mean $\tmu=\mu/2^d$ ,
  $\tsigma = \sigma \sqrt {\frac{T}{2^b}}$,
  add them up according to time and record them as
  $X_k = \sum_{1\leq i \leq k} x_i$ with $X_1=X_0+x_1$.
\item Calculate the $\alpha_j$ quantiles 
  $M_{j,s}\triangleq M_{\alpha_j 2^s,2^s}$ for sequence 
  $\Set{X_k|k=i 2^{d-s}, 1\leq i\leq 2^{s}}$, where $b\leq s \leq d$. 
\item Use $M_{j,d}$ as the continuous quantiles $M(\alpha_j , T)$.
\item Repeat the above for $L$ times,
  get a sequence of data $\Set{M_{j,s}^{(l)}}_{1\leq l\leq L}$
\item Calculate the mean of errors for $s < d$:
\begin{align}
Err_{j,s} &= {\frac{1}{L}\left(\sum_{1\leq l \leq L} M_{j,d}^{(l)} - M_{j,s}^{(l)}\right)}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

We realize this algorithm for $d=27$, $b=6$, $\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2=1$, $T=1$, $X_0=0$ and generate more than 2000 sampled paths. As you can see in Figure \ref{f:err}, Figure \ref{f:lerr} and Figure \ref{f:rate}, the simulation results are coincident with our theoretical conclusion.

%for some constant $C$. This always is the case when $f$ is the

%\end{equation}

%By this, we can say the convergence rate of $\alpha$-quantile European-style options at least 1/2.

\section{$\alpha$-quantile option}
\subsection{The advantage of $\alpha$-quantile options}
$\alpha$-quantile options, also known as quantile options, are a type of options whose payoff are functions of the quantiles of underlying asset price process. For 

As we discussed before, lookback option is a path-dependent option with payoff calculated with the maximum or minimum price of the underlying asset achieved during the life of the option. For example, a fixed strike lookback call option get the highest value obtained within the option's lifetime. In this case, to the holder, it can be viewed as a protection against large drop of stock price. This can be regarded as a method to deal with the unfavorable movement of a particular stock, such as the release of a prolonged lawsuit which may have a strong negative effect on the stock price. On the other side, lookback put option provides an insurance against large rises. But these characters also makes lookback options too expensive. A $\alpha$-quantile option is one product that overcomes this shortcoming of lookbacks. Quantile option is cheaper than lookbacks, while it still provide partial protection against market movements. This property of quantile option was first discussed by \cite{Ballotta2001}.


Another advantage of quantile option is that the strong path dependence of its payoff make it immunize to possible market manipulation. Because the payoff of lookback only involves the maximum of a stock price during option's lifetime. Particularly for at the money option close to maturity, which in this case are most vulnerable to the stock price movement closing to maturity. Firms have influence on market price can use this advantage to lead market price move to their favorable direction. But since quantile option is strongly path-dependent, the manipulation effect is limited. 


\subsection{Tree method for a European $\alpha$-quantile option}
\label{se:fsg}


Like lookback option, quantile option is also path-dependent. What makes things difficult is that quantile option is not Markov. Normal tree methods which usually involve backward induction do not work in this case. We need to record all the information of the path because of lack of Markov property, which will lead the tree to explosion computationally.
\cite{Kwok2001} proposed a special way to apply tree method to price quantile option. In this paper, they find a relation between the price of quantile option and the price of cumulative Parisian option. By this approximation, they can simplify the pricing of quantile option. In their paper, they assume that there are $M$ time steps for the whole monitoring period $[0,T]$, and they define ${S^M}_j$, $j = - M$, ...$0$,$1$,...,$M$ as the discrete asset prices at maturity. Under trinomial tree method, the possible prices happened in one tree are limited to $S^M_j$,  $j = - M$, ...$0$,$1$, ...,$M$, which is also true for the value taken by quantile of Brownian motion. Therefore they derived that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kowk1}
V(\alpha, T) = e^{-rT} \sum^{M}_{j=-M}P[M(\alpha,T)=S^{M}_{j}]\max(S^{M}_{j}-X,0),
\end{equation}
where $V(\alpha,T)$ is for the value of $\alpha$-quantile option whose maturity it $T$, $P[M(\alpha,T)=S^{M}_{j}]$ is the probability that the quantile of Brownian motion achieve the value ${S^M}_j$,  $j = - M$, ...$0$,$1$, ...,$M$. In their paper, they observed that the difference between the prices of two cumulative Parisian binary options is a good approximation for $P[M(\alpha,T)=S^{M}_{j}]$ multiplies discount factor $e^{-rT}$, ie.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kowk2}
e^{-rT}P[M(\alpha,T)=S^{M}_{j}] \approx V^{bin}_{cum}[(1-\alpha)T, S^{M}_{j-1}]-V_{cum}^{bin}[(1-\alpha)T, S_{j}^{M}]
\text{ for }j=-M, ... , 0, 1, ... , M
\end{equation}
where $V^{bin}_{cum}[d,B]$ is denoted as the price of continuously monitored cumulative Parisian binary option with down barrier $B$, and $d$ be the minimum cumulative time staying above the down barrier to avoid knock-out.


Combining equation (\ref{eq:kowk1})and (\ref{eq:kowk2}), they get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kowk3}
V_{alp} = \sum^M_{j=-M} \max (S^M_j - X,0) \times \{V_{cum}^{bin}[(1-\alpha)T, S^M_{j-1}] - V^{bin}_{cum}[(1-\alpha)T, S^M_j]\} ,
\end{equation}
where $V^{bin}_{cum}[(1-\alpha)T, S_{-(M+1)}^M] = e^{-rT}$. By this result, we can turn pricing of quantile option into pricing of $2M+1$ cumulative Parisian option.


Parisian option is like an advanced version of barrier option. We know barrier options are options where the payoff depends on whether the underlying asset's price reaches a certain level (barrier) during the option's life. Barrier options usually trade in the over-the counter market. This kind of option is attractive because it is usually cheaper than similar option without barrier. Like vanilla option, barrier options also authorize holders the right to buy or sell, but  long sides of barrier options do not need to pay for scenarios they think is unlikely to happen in the future. One good example I find from Wikipedia is about IBM. If you believe that IBM will go up this year, but are willing to bet that it won't go above \$100, then you can buy the barrier and pay fewer premium than the vanilla option. But in this one-touch knock-out or knock-in can bring difficulties to option writers when asset price is close to barrier. Particularly in the foreign exchange market where manipulation of underlying asset price is not impossible. To overcome short period price manipulation, various adjustments to one-touch knock out or knock-in have been performed in practice. Parisian option is one solution.  In order to get activated, the underlying assets of Parisian option need to stay in the knout out or knout in region for certain period of time. The payoff of a cumulative Parisian option is dependent on the total amount of time the underlying asset price has spent above or below barrier. As for binary option, the payoff is either some fixed amount of some asset or nothing at all.



Kwok and Lau also proposed a forward shorting grid(FSG) to price cumulative Parisian option in \cite{Kwok2001}. The character of FSG is that this approach need add additional information at each node of  a lattice tree. Commonly in pricing path-dependent option, at each node we should add state vector to represent the path-dependent attribute, such as the extreme value of the underlying asset price achieved in lookback option case. As we know \cite{Hull1993} and \cite{Vijh1993} were the first authors suggested this approach. \cite{Barraquand1996} introduced a comprehensive framework for FSG. In this paper they indicated that the FSG method is unconditionally convergent. Further, they showed that when the covariance matrix is degenerate, the FSG method can outperform finite difference methods. The convergence of the FSG algorithm in pricing of Asian options was studied by \cite{Forsyth1999}.

In \cite{Kwok2001}, they constructed a trinomial tree to get the price of cumulative Parisian option. But due to the fact that the result is not steady according to the setting of the length of up movement between each immediate step, we modify their method to binomial tree.

In building binomial tree, we start by cutting the entire life of one option into many small time intervals of length $\Delta t = T / M$.
Our tree is build to mimic the logarithm process of underlying asset price. Denote $x=\ln S$. In each step, the logarithm of the price of underlying asset is assumed to move from its initial value of $x_0$ to one of the two new values, $x_0 + d + u$ and $x_0 + d - u$ with equal probability, that is $p_{up} = p_{down} = 0.5$ , where $u = \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$ and $d = (r - {\sigma}^2 /2)\Delta t$. Here $\sigma$, and $r$ are volatility and risk-free interest rate, respectively. The model is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:tree1}.
\begin{figure}[p]

   \label{fig:tree1}
\end{figure}

Like the notation used in \cite{Kwok2001}, we denote $V[m,j;k]$ as the numerical option value of the cumulative Parisian option at the $m$-th time interval,  $j$ upward jumps from the initial underlying asset value and $k$ times breaches so far. Let $g(k,j)$ be the grid function that describes the correlated evolution of number of breaches $k$ and price indicate $j$. Denote $x_j$ be the value of $x$ corresponding to $j$ upward movements on the binomial tree. Then we should add $1$ to the indicator $k$ if the underlying asset price $S$ is no more than the barrier $B$; i.e $x_j \leq \ln B$. Hence we can see that a suitable setting of the grid evolution function $g(k,j)$ should be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:grid}
g(k,j) = k + 1_{\Set{x_j \leq B}}
\end{equation}
where $1_{\set{x_j \leq B}}$ is the indicator function. It is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:grid-indicator}
1_{\Set{x_j \leq B}} =  \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x_j \leq \ln B \\
0 & \text{if } x_j > \ln B
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Then the FSG method for pricing the cumulative Parisian binary option can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fsg}
V[m-1,j;k] =\set{0.5V[m,j+1;g(k,j+1)]+0.5V[m,j-1,g(k,j-1)]}e^{-r\Delta t}
\end{equation}
for $m-1 < M$.


Let $N$ be the predetermined number of breaches recorded for the all duration of the life of an option that is desired to activate   the contract.
Considering the binary feature of the option, we should initiate our algorithm with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:initiate}
V[M,j;k] = \begin {cases}
1 & \text{if }  k < N \\
0 & \text{if }  k \geq N
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
By (\ref{eq:initiate})  (\ref{eq:fsg}) and backward induction, we can get the price of cumulative Parisian binary option with any prescribed times of breaches and barrier.

Recall what we get by equation (\ref{eq:kowk2}). In order to get the price of $\alpha$-quantile option, we can use the prices of $2M + 1$ cumulative Parisian binary options to approximate $\alpha$-quantile option's value. Hence using the FSG method we described above to calculate the prices of cumulative Parisian option  and doing a simple math work by equation (\ref{eq:kowk2}), we can get the approximated price for $\alpha$-quantile option with $M$ time steps.

Recall we defined earlier $\Delta t = T / M$. We compute the approximated option price of an $\alpha$-quantile call option with different time steps using equation (\ref{eq:kowk2}). As you can see in Figure (\ref{fig:2}),
the numerical values of option are plotted against varying $\Delta t$. The values of parameters of the $\alpha$-quantile call option are set as: $\alpha = 0.8$, $S_0 = 100$, $X = 95$, $r = 5\%$, $\sigma = 20\%$, and $T = 0.25$.

%\subsection{A static hedging for $\alpha$-quantile put option}
Inspired by the approximation of quantile option using cumulative Parisian options, we here propose a static hedging of quantile options using cumulative binary Parisian options. As we discussed earlier, the payoff of a cumulative binary Parisian option is that: only if the price of stock spend enough time under a predetermined barrier, its payoff is \$1; otherwise, its payoff is 0, it is worth nothing. We explicitly account for the discreteness of the tick size. That is the value of stock price only can be multiples of 1/8. Then for a put quantile option, the intuition for our hedging lies in the ability to rephrase the question, what was the certain quantile of stock price as several questions. 

For example, for $40\%$-quantile put option with stock price started from 1 and strike price 2, we can replicate its payoff using cumulative Parisian options which are alive only if they spend more than $0.4*T$ time under their barrier. For the quantile option, it has payoff only if the $40$ percentile is less than 2, the strike price. Also it is obvious that $40$ percentile must be larger than 0. In this sense, we hold 0.125 share of each cumulative binary Parisian binary option with barrier raging from $0.125. 0.250, 0.375., 2$.  If in the end of maturity, the 40 percentile of stock price is larger than 2, the quantile option gets nothing. Since the 40 percentile is larger than 2, then the stock price must be under 2 for less than 40$\%$ of the time before maturity. In this case all the binary option gets nothing. But if the quantile is $1.750$, the quantile option gets a payoff of $0.250=2-1.750$. While for the binary options, in this case, options with barrier $2$ and $1.875$ are alive. The payoff you can get from binary options is $0.125*2=0.250$. That is the payoff of the collections of binary options is identical to your quantile option. These are true for other scenarios of the value of quantile.  In other words, by holding a collection of cumulative Parisian binary option, we can realize a static hedging.

Probably, you have already found out that this scheme only works for European puts, because that you can find the two side boundary of effective quantile. This condition is not true for calls. 


\subsection{A tree method for American $\alpha$-quantile option}
Non-Markov property of  the quantile of Brownian motion cause serious problem 
when we want to use tree method. We need to record all the information alone the
path, at least, we have to record the occupation time of $X_k$.
 
In risk-neutral world, we always can write the price of 
American option in following way:
\[
C = \sup_{\tau\leq T} Ef(X_\tau^\alpha,\tau),
\]
where $\tau$ are any stopping time stops before $T$, 
\[
f(x,t) = 
\begin{cases}
e^{-rt}(x-K)^+ & \text{for call option}\\
e^{-rt}(K-x)^+ & \text{for put option}
\end{cases}
\]
as usual.
This is an optimal stopping problem. 

The obvious way to solve this numerically, is using tree method. 
Discrete the time, i.e. let $0=t_0< t_1, \cdots, t_n$.
Let $P_k=(X_0, \cdots, X_k)$ be a path of Geometric Brownian motion, 
Then $X_{k+1}$ can only be $X_{k}+u$ and $X_{k}-d$ in probability
$p^+$ and $p^-$  where $u,d,p^+$ and $p^-$ are prefixed 
constants in usual binomial tree method, each will .
Then let 
\[
\mathrm{Pay}_{P_j} = e^{rt_j}f(X_{P_j}^\alpha, t_j)
%=
%\begin{cases}
%(x-K)^+ & \text{for call option}\\
%(K-x)^+ & \text{for put option}
%\end{cases}
\] 
be the payoff if the option holder exercise the option at time $t_j$, 
where $X_{P_n}^\alpha$ denotes the $\alpha$-quantile of path $P_n$. 
For $n$, let 
\[
C_{P_n} = \mathrm{Pay}_{P_n}
\]
For $j< n$, 
let 
\[
C_{P_j} = \max\Set{E_{P_j}, \mathrm{Pay}_{P_j}}
\]
where
\[
E_{P_j} = e^{-r(t_{j+1}-t_j)}(p^+C_{(P_j,X_j+u)} + p^-C_{(P_j,X_j-d)})
\]
is the expectation return if the holder of the option
do not exercise his right at time $t_j$, providing the historical data of 
the stock price is given by $P_j$. 

Now the optimal stopping time is given by 
\[
\tau(P_n) = \inf\Set{t_j| Pay_{P_j}\geq E_{P_j}}
\]
here $P_j$ is the restriction of $P_n$ at $(t_0, \cdots, t_j)$, i.e. 
\[
P_j = (X_0, \cdots, X_j) \text{ if } P_n=(X_0, \cdots, X_n). 
\] 

Hence $C_{(0)}$ is the price of American $\alpha$-quantile option at time $t_0$. Based on this observation, we have a recurrence relation for computing $C_{(0)}$.

It is nature to realize this scheme by using the ``Depth First Search'' algorithm. Depth first search (DFS) is an standard algorithm for visiting all nodes and generating all possible path in a tree. The character of this method is that we start form the root of a tree and explore as deep as possible until the end of each branch before backtracking. In practice, we build the tree with depth $n+1$, each non-leaves nod has two children corresponding to $\Set{X_j+u,X_j-d}$. Hence the complexity of this ``brute force'' method is $O(2^n)$. It is clear that all the nodes at depth $j$ correspond to one and only one path $P_j$. So we label the node by $N_{P_j}$.  For any node, say $N_{P_j}$, we first compute $C_{P_{j+1}}$, where the possible $N_{P_{j+1}}$ are all of its two children. After visiting all its children and computing $C_{P_{j+1}}$, it backtracks to node $N_{P_j}$, and computes $E_{P_j}, Pay_{P_j}$ and then $C_{P_j}$. After that, it goes back to the parent of $N_{P_j}$. Now we apply the same process to $N_{P_{j-1}}$  as we do to $N_{P_{j}}$. In other words, if it does not finish visiting all its children, it will visit the next one; if it finishes visiting all the children, it will compute the value of the note and go back to its parent. 

Because the computational time of this method is going exponentially as the steps increasing. It is very time consuming to obtain an result with large steps. To solve this question, we propose an extrapolation method to improve the converge speed.

Richardson extrapolation is a method to accelerate the sequence convergence rate first studied by \cite{Richardson}.
Let $v(h)$ be the approximate price of the option got from the tree method with step length $h$. Suppose the tree method is of order $\gamma$.  
We have 
\[
v(h) = v_0 + Ch^\gamma + o(h^\gamma)
\]
where $v_0$ is the true value of the $\alpha$-quantile option.
Now we compute for two different step length $h_1, h_2$. 
Then 
\begin{align}
h_1^\gamma v(h_2) &= v_0 h_1^\gamma + C(h_1h_2)^\gamma + o(h_2^\gamma) \label{eq:exs1}\\
h_2^\gamma v(h_1) &= v_0 h_2^\gamma + C(h_1h_2)^\gamma + o(h_1^\gamma) \label{eq:exs2}
\end{align}
Consider (\ref{eq:exs1})-(\ref{eq:exs2}),
we get
\[
v_0(h_1^\gamma - h_2^\gamma) \approx h_1^\gamma v(h_2) - h_2^\gamma v(h_1)
\]
i.e. 
\[
v_0 \approx \frac{ h_1^\gamma v(h_2) - h_2^\gamma v(h_1)}{
  h_1^\gamma - h_2^\gamma}
= \frac{\eta^\gamma v(h_2) - v(h_1)}{\eta^\gamma -1 },
\]
where $\eta = h_1/h_2$.

In our case, denote $C_n$ be the value corresponding to $n$ steps. Based on the conclusion in section \ref{sec:de}, it is reasonable to assume that our tree method converges on order 1. That is $\gamma = 1$. 
Then the true value of $\alpha$-quantile option 
\[
C_\infty \approx \frac{\eta C_{n_2} - C_{n_1}}{\eta-1},
\]
where $\eta = (T/n_1)/(T/n_2) = n_2/n_1$.
This is the general form of Richardson extrapolation.
If take $n_2=2n, n_1=n$, we get the usual Richardson extrapolation formula
\[
C_\infty \approx 2 C_{2n} - C_n. 
\]

Because there is no other method to price American $\alpha$-quantile option so far. In other words, there does not exist direct result acting as an comparing standard. However, since conceptually our tree should also work for European $\alpha$-quantile option, here we first compare the results using this tree method with value obtained by other method.

Comparing the results by our tree method with extrapolation, Forward shooting grid and Monte Carlo method, we think our tree method is correct and efficient. Since, as we checked, it works well for European $\alpha$-quantile option, it should also work for American style $\alpha$ quantile option. 

For parameters setting as
\[
K=100, r=0.05, \sigma=0.2, \alpha=0.5, T=1
\]
, with our tree method, we get the price of American $\alpha$-quantile option in Table \ref{fig:amer5}. Comparing data in Table \ref{fig:euro5} and Table \ref{fig:amer5}, we can see price for American option is more expensive than European-style optionwith same feature. This again insures that our method is correct.

\section{Connect the discrete and continuous $\alpha$-quantile options}
We follow \cite{Broadie1999}.

In this section we omit the subscript $\alpha$ and $k$. Denote 
$M$ and $M_m$ be the $\alpha$ quantile of Brownian motion with drift $\mu$ 
and variance $\sigma$ at time $T$ and its step length $T/m$ version
 respectively. 

From the previous section, we know the mean of discretization error satisfies
\[
E(M-M_m) = \beta /m + O(m^{-\frac{3}{2}}),
\]
where 
\[
\beta = - \frac{\tsigma\sqrt{T}}{4}\left((2g'(\mu_1)-\mu_1)\sqrt{\alpha} 
  -(2g'(\mu_2)-\mu_2)\sqrt{(1-\alpha)}\right).
\]

We find 
\[
\begin{split}
 & E(e^{M_m} - x)^+ \\
=& 
E(e^M-x)^+ - E(e^M-e^{M_m}; e^M,e^{M_m}>x)\\
&+E(e^{M_m}-x;e^{M_m}\geq x > e^M)
-E(e^M-x;e^M\geq x > e^{M_m})\\
=& A - B + C + D
\end{split}
\]

Assume $m(e^M-e^{M_m})$ convergence in distribution to some random variable $U$.
Then, 
\[
0 \leq C \leq E(e^{M_m}-e^M;e^{M_m}\geq x > e^M)
\] 
Since $P(e^{M_m}\geq x > e^M) \rightarrow 0$,
\[
E(m(e^{M_m}-e^M);e^{M_m}\geq x > e^M) \rightarrow 0
\]
by the uniformly integrability. So $C$ and similarly $D$ is $o(1/m)$.
If the assumption is not true, if we can prove
\begin{equation}
E(e^{M_m}-e^M;e^{M_m}\geq x > e^M) \sim o(1/m) \label{eq:sp1}
\end{equation}
it is also OK. 

Now, 
\begin{align}
  B =&  E(e^M-e^{M_m}; e^M,e^{M_m}>x) \notag \\
  =& E(e^M-e^{M_m}; e^M>x) -  E(e^M-e^{M_m}; e^{M_m}<x<e^M) \notag \\
  =& E(e^M-e^{M_m}; e^M>x) + o(1/m) \notag \\
  =& E(e^M \beta/m;e^M>x) +o(1/m) \label{eq:sp2}
\end{align}

Hence,
\begin{align}
 & E((e^{M_m}-x)^+) \notag\\
=& E((e^M-x);e^M>x) - E(e^M \beta/m;e^M>x) + o(1/m) \notag\\
=& E(e^M(1-\beta/m)-x;e^M>x) + o(1/m) \notag \\
=& E[e^{M-\beta/m}-x;e^M>x] + o(1/m) \label{eq:cor1}\\
=& e^{-\beta/m}E(e^M-xe^{\beta/m};e^M>x) + o(1/m) \notag\\
=& e^{-\beta/m}E(e^M-xe^{\beta/m};e^M>xe^{\beta/m})  \notag\\
 & +e^{-\beta/m}E(e^M-xe^{\beta/m};e^M\in [xe^{\beta/m}, x])  + o(1/m)\label{eq:sp3}\\
= & e^{-\beta/m}E[e^M-xe^{\beta/m};e^M>xe^{\beta/m}] + o(1/m) \\
= & e^{-\beta/m}E[(e^M-xe^{\beta/m})^+] + o(1/m) \label{eq:cor2}
\end{align}
Now both equation (\ref{eq:cor1}) and (\ref{eq:cor2}) 
are correction formulas.


For equation (\ref{eq:sp3}),
\[
\begin{split}
&|E(e^M-xe^{-\beta/m};e^M\in [xe^{-\beta/m}, x])|\\
\leq& x|1-e^{-\beta/m}|P(M \in [\log x,\log x -\beta/m])\\
=& O(1/m)O(1/m) = o(1/m) 
\end{split}
\]
The inequality is obtained by observation. The second is because the density function is finite and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

\def\bM{\overline{M}}
\def\darrow{\xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}}}
\def\Cov{\mathrm{Cov}}
Now we discuss the equation (\ref{eq:sp2}).
Use Taylor expansion, we get
\[
e^{M_m}-e^M = e^M(M_m-M) + \frac{1}{2}e^{\bM_m}(M_m-M)^2
\]
for some $\bM_m$ between $M$ and $M_m$.

Similarly, to get equation (\ref{eq:cor1}), using Taylor expansion, we find
\[
e^{M-\frac{\beta}{m}}= e^{M} - e^M(M-\frac{\beta}{m}-M) + \frac{1}{2}e^{\tM_m}(M-\frac{\beta}{m}-M)^2
\]
for some $\tM_m$ between $M-\frac{\beta}{m}$ and $M$. 


Now assume 
\[
m^\gamma(M-M_m)=W_m \darrow W,
\]
where $\gamma > \frac{1}{2}$ as we see in the simulation.
As later, we will prove $e^{\bM_m}m^{2\gamma}(M-M_m)^2$ is uniformly integrable.
So 
\[
m^{2\gamma}(E[e^M]-E[e^{M_m}] - E[e^M(M-M_m)])\darrow C,
\]
for some constant. 
Hence, 
\begin{align}
&E[e^M]-E[e^{M_m}] \notag \\
=& E[e^M(M-M_m)] + C m^{-2\gamma} +o(m^{-2\gamma}) \notag\\
=& E[e^M]E[M-M_m] + \Cov(e^M,M-M_m) + o(1/m) \notag\\
=& E[e^M]\beta/m +  \Cov(e^M,M-M_m) + o(1/m)\notag\\
=& E[e^M]\beta/m + o(1/m) \label{eq:sp4}
\end{align}
To verify equation (\ref{eq:sp4}) we need to justify 
\[
\Cov(e^M,M-M_m)\sim o(1/m),
\]
by uniformly integrability argument? 

To check the uniformly integrability of $e^{\bM_m}m^{2\gamma}(M-M_m)^2$,
we use the Schwarz inequality.
\[
E[(e^{\bM_m}m^{2\gamma}(M-M_m)^2)^2]
\leq E[e^{4\bM_m}] E[(m^{2\gamma}(M-M_m))^4]
\]
But, we have 
\[
\sup_mE[e^{p\bM_m}] \leq E[e^p\max_{0\leq t\leq T}B_t] < \infty \quad \forall p>0.
\]
If we have 
\[
\sup_m E[|m^{2\gamma}(M-M_m)|^4] \leq \infty
\]
we can prove the uniformly integrability. 

In fact, we can modify this proof by using H\"older's inequality, then 
we only need
\[
\sup_m E[|m^{2\gamma}(M-M_m)|^p] < \infty 
\]
for some $p>2$.
