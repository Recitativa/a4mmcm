\chapter{Abstract}
Option is one of the most popular derivative traded in the market. 
%So evaluate the value of options is
%a very important question in finicial industry.
%However the return of options can only be determined when it is exercised.
%So option pricing became a very difficult problem.
In the most important model, the Black-Scholes model, for option pricing, the price of the underlying asset is assumed to satisfy the geometric Brownian motion, which is a very interesting object itself. In this thesis, we provide a quick review about the theory of option pricing in the first part of this thesis. It is well known that the Black-Scholes formula solves the pricing problem for a European option. However, for other types of options, usually there is no such closed-form formula. Numerical methods are developed to solve these problems. In this thesis, we consider the $\alpha$-quantile options. Partially because the $\alpha$-quantiles of Brownian motion are highly path-dependent, many fundamental problems are still open. One problem is the discretization error between the $\alpha$-quantile of Brownian motion and that of the Gaussian random walk. This is the first step to find the order of approximation for numerical 
methods based on Gaussian random walk. We have found a difference between the convergence patterns of the discretization error for genuine $\alpha$-quantiles $(0< \alpha < 1)$ and the maximum ($\alpha=1$) by simulation. Moreover we establish this result theoretically. Another problem is with using tree methods to price $\alpha$-quantile options. Although a forward shooting method proposed by \cite{Kwok2001} can be used to price European-style $\alpha$-quantile options, the method can not be extended to price the American-style option.  We propose a tree method which can price both European-style and American-style $\alpha$-quantile options. We show how Richardson extrapolation can be applied to accelerate the convergence speed of our lattice method.
