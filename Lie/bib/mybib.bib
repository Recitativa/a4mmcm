	from multiresolution is presented. The method uses only properties
	of shift-invariant spaces and orthogonal projectors fromL2(Rd) onto
	these spaces, and requires neither decay nor stability of the scaling
	function. Furthermore, this approach allows a simple derivation of
	previous, as well as new, constructions of wavelets, and leads to
	a complete resolution of questions concerning the nature of the intersection
	and the union of a scale of spaces to be used in a multiresolution.},
